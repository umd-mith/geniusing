[Intro: Common]
You know they be asking ’bout Common, where he at?
What that man doing now?
I’m doing what I do, hip-hop
That's what I do
Yeah
How can I say this, fuck it I’m the greatest
I am the A-list for all these great debaters
A lot of ya’ll nah nah, forgot now who I am
The '87 nigga used to rah rah in the jam
Aw yeah, we put them things in the air
When I drop a single, it’s really like a pair
Of Air Jordans, important to the culture
If you ain't true to it, cállate la boca
Get my drink on like a coaster
Post up on the wall that Mike used to live off
Hip-hop Master Cleansin', I’mma get my shit off
Rollin’ in a Maserati Gran with the lid off
I bit all like a monster, live nigga this is my encore
Encore, encore,
I rhyme for the commoners
My name synonymous with prominence
I’m to Hip-Hop what Obama is to politics
Common is
[Interlude]
Yeah, man
Y’all niggas man, you soft muthafuckers
Yeah my man, muthafucker
Then come around my crib
You know where I’m from
Some ho ass niggas
Singing all around me man, la la la
You ain't muthafucking Frank Sinatra
Uh, lil' bitch
Yeah, this the raw right here
This the raw right here nigga
Sweet muthafucka
Sweet ass bitch muthafucka
Wa da da da, wa dada dada dang
The C-O double-M O-N, I’m not playin’
Da da man at work, I make my own lane
I’m the franchise so I rock my own chain
No I said give 'em that 80′s cocaine
Somethin’ raw, something pure so I stayed in that vein
The hero that he know, that he cold
Like when it's below in the G.O.,
wipe ya feet off in the Regal
I’m king, observe the throne and the dream
supreme like mathematics
Yeah, a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
Pro black magic, this is semi-automatic
Rap we won’t jam in traffic
The game need direction, I’m here to map it
Uh, some people say that they be missing creativity
But when it come to hip-hop, it begins and ends with me
Sweet
You know man, you should know where I come from
You should know who I am nigga
You should never wanna go against me
