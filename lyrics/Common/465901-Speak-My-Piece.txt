[Hook : The Notorious B.I.G.]
I just, speak my piece, keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps
Packing, my piece, Jesus
Packing, my piece, Jesus
I'm iller than most, sick with it, feeling the dose
In a butter soft leather but I'm still with the toast
Feel the ghost of Notorious, tell me who the naughtiest
She get live like an audience
I do what I do, no need to state the obvious
Light a J, it's just me and Marley, look at the poster
Do what I supposed to for the culture
Early b-boy, down with d-boys, build and destroy
My pride and joy is my daughter named Omoye
'Ye, that's my nigga from back in the day
All that whoop-de-wah-whoop, man fuck what they say
Lay it down for the world, for Chicago I stand, and
Popular girls always wanna pop in my world
I pop out in the boroughs and go to L.A. to get hay
In the middle of the barn with a princess I laid
Yo, this type of shit happens every um, once in a while
Bring life to the party like a woman and child
Ah! Made the unmade-able
Ah! Go to parties I'm paid to go
About doing good business like Rick and Russell
You I know I guzzle red wine till it's bed time
My time, the streets is watching like a Rollie
Do it for the hometown and the homies, uh
