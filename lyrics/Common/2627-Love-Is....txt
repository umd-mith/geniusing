How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end
It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
it's the scrimmage
