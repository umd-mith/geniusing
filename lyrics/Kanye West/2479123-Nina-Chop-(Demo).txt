Midwest coast back, nigga
And don't say 'nigga' unless of course you black, nigga
Free country, they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all their white daughters drinkin' Hennessy
I'mma go to Sal's with some niggas on the wall
I might go to Oz, take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano's so involved
I know, King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had two Polos
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent
go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They ask about the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff
You know
