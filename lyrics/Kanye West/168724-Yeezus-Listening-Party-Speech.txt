If you ever see somebody next to me, know that they're better than me at something
So it's really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously, the way we put this shit together, y'all comin' out here tonight vibin' with us. In the way this whole albums put together.
The amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively, collaboratively.
We didn't give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin' in, anything.
We just wanted to make the best product possible.
And this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people.
What I said last night is like
we drop this shit June 18th
This ain't about waitin' until August and havin' some big this and that.
It's about deliverin' some shit for y'all to go to work to, ride to, listen to while y'all workin' out and shit. Whatever y'all doin' to provide a soundtrack for this shit that's gon' come out. We gon' keep on doin' this shit over and over and over. Makin' shit for my core, my cut

all the Been Trill family,
Daft Punk workin' like 3-4 joints on the album.
"Onsite", "I Am A God",
Mike Dean
Travis Scott
Hudson Mohawke
Arca.
Rick Rubin comin' in and finishing up the whole shit for us
'Numbers on the Boards",
from the video to the "NO ARTWORK" to the sound of the song and everything.
"What would Rick Rubin do? What was his Def Jam shit that they were doing?"
Because I remember like Ricky would say, "When we did Def Jam, we wasn't really feelin' like we was in competition with nobody, cause this shit was so direct."
We in the middle of the city right now,
over into the motherfuckin' streets and nobody shuttin' down shit while we makin' real music
So it's good for me to go to the God, Rick Rubin, and play him my shit.
And I wanted to explain something about the title Yeezus
Simply put: West was my slave name and Yeezus is my god name
