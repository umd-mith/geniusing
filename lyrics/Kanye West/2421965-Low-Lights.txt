You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me. 

Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there, because he...
He's gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out  his hand and guide me through
Oh yes he will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, he will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day he will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.

No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I'm crying now
It feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh lord thank you
You are the joy of my life.
