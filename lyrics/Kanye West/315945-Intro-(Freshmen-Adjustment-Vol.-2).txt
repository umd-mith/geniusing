Oh oh oh oh, I'm good, so good
Even better than I was the last time, baby (x3)
Oh oh oh oh, I'm good, so good, so good
[Verse: Kanye West]
It's your boy, Kanye to the
And we back
Yo John, can't complain, huh?
Shit nigga, you got a deal on Def Jam
Got Cons with me, we in the works
Got my best friend GLC, the Knockout King
Through the doctor's exact calculations
He said, "Nigga, you almost bust the Final Destination
Shit, you must have had a blessing from Pastor Mason"
'Cause that trip to L.A. could have been my last vacation, what?
I mean, there's people at war right now
We can't be sitting up here, complaining about the bills
