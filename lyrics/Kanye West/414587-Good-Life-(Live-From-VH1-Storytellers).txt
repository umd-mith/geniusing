I mean, I didn’t expect the losses and you expect everything to work out well
But I expected real life
And then I suffered the worst pains to help me to grow
Because they’re all in God’s plan and help make me the man I am today
[Intro]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me "baby"
And if you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, like we always do at this time

[Hook]
I go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I, gotta go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
Imma get on the TV momma and I'mma
Yo, I'mma put shit down
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) ayyy
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) [I'm good]

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the good life, where homies who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Man, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, [it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A. it feel like Miami
[It feel like N.Y. summertime Chi
Ahhhhh! Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk,I pop the hood - Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look - sorry!

[Bridge]
Yo it's gots to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks - Lawry's
50 told me [go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate, watch the money pile up


[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Welcome to the good life! Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got mo' (ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Philly
It feel like D.C. it feel like D.C
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Ayy!
Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood?
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin money's not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
I always had a passion for flashin
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined
The good life

Everybody wants the good life
Welcome to the good life
Let me hear you say:
Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'm GOOD!
Better than the life I lived
When I though that I was gonna go crazy

[Hook x3]
