Greetings, earthlings. Take me to your leader (ooh shit!)
Deeper than the page of a book let me look
Deeper than deep dish
hammers and vogues
Deeper than thee fish in the O(cean)
I got my gun on standby, like Coast Guards
You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like erb, word (hey man)
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching plagues
Niggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggas on they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your muthafucking spine
No, I make that three cause I don't wanna hear you whine
Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie
Andre Ben' slamming backs like King acts
Over Organized tracks full of facts
What? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill
He will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway
Aiming for your skull, yeah I'm flexing on you that a way
So if you pulling a tool, nigga you better use it
Cause if you're threatening my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it
I don't take no shit from nobody
I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn, no pain, no gain, so I'mma hurt you
Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
So if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it
[Verse 3: André 3000]
No, I ain't never been pimped by the system
That's because I ain't no slave
Don't be trying to sunbathe
never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted cause I'm zooted
bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be having funds
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I gets a little backup
Please don't let them Dixie muthafuckas put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we equal
Whenever the fuck our record comes out in 1994
Yeah, yes sir, it's like that
Gonna take y'all deep, so go back
And pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy
And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cause you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L
