They don't know, but I do though
Baby my darling you make me lose composure
Fragments of a million me
Scattered across the floor to a certain degree
Where I had to give your mama call
And thank her for spending time with your daddy
What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
Ounce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant
And once I done had some Cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like Tony Mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky
And I like them red hot Fila straight from Walters off the chain
Fuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you
Cause you push a big black Buick, so fresh, so clean on them Trues
Slum beautiful you's the would to me, shawty I dig ya
And I'm loving the way them Jordache got a bear hug on your figure
You my nigga, nigga
Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you
You're looking deliciously divine darling you really and truly do
The very thought of has got me running at the speed of love
Exploring everything about you from the ground to the God above
Suddenly I started dreaming, traveling in time so fast
I could almost taste outer space
I saw the face of God and looked like you and me too
Hello, I'm the man that God made you for
Forever's gonna be so fun
I don't know but, it seem like uh, your daddy must have gave you
A teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed
Or was it a pack of Now & Laters cause you're the sweetest thing on my head
And I'd like to say that I'd love to make love to every molecule of you
And if you want to spontaneously combust that's what we'll do in unison
