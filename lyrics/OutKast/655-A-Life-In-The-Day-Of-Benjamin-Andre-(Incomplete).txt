I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like "Yeah, nigga, right"
But you gave me your number anyway
You were on the talcum...
Powder
How's about them oranges?
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impo-ssible
We were both the same age, but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page, but in
The same book of life, so I'd page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking: "cool"
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be
Heaven or hell
The angelic nastiness
you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You'd dropped me off by the Dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
"Now are these niggas in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?"
Well, yes and no
Yes, we were selling it
But no, it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled "ho!"
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear
You know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve 7 digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied 'See you later' when he got the good news
That's life shit
Now, I'm 19 with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop
So I got a Glock
and a LoJack
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much 'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more, follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you, tell me then I'll double back
But keep in mind, at the time "keep it real" was the phrase
Silly once said now, but those were the days
When Spring Break, and Daytona, and Freakniks
Made you wanna, drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak
Moment,
on went myself and Big Boi
Well, you knew him as 'Twan
That's right, you were around before this shit begun
When 'Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like jack
Yak
Girls used to say, 'Y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?'
And I'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling
'No, I'm from Atlanta, baby
He from Savannah
maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes'
She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants
15-love, fit like glove
Description is like 15 doves
In a Jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?
Enough about me, how's about you?
How's the lil' kid?
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note
Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see I'd balled out, and before I fall out
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread
macaroni niggas, imposters
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now you know her as Erykah "On and On" Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone, 'Why you
Do that girl like that, boy, you ought to be ashamed'
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name
We're young, in love, in short we had fun
No regrets no abortion, had a son
By the name of Seven, and he's 5
By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be 6
You do the arithmetic
Me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart
And take you from the start
To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Mama or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
You fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got
(music fades)
[Radio Interview]
And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go
Knowing the whole summer that's all you could think about
Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up
You need a jump, like your need and your want to grow
And you change all the time
So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer
The next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more
You wanted something bigger and better

(Interviewer)
So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?

(Andre)
Right...right, so now you want a Cadillac...
