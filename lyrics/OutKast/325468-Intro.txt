Live, from the center of the Earth
Seven light-years below sea level we go
Welcome to Stankonia, the place from which all funky things come
Would you like to come?
(Girl Moaning)
Bounce baby. (We're bouncing)
Bounce. Bounce. (We're bouncing)
Two times bounce bounce. (We're bouncing)
We're bouncing. (We're bouncing)
Bounce. (We're bouncing baby)
(We're bouncing!) Come on, bounce
(Bouncing! Bounce baby) Bounce!
Bounce, bounce. (Hey Baby!) Bounce, bounce
(Let's bounce) Come on, bounce. (Everybody let's bounce)
(Let's bounce) We bouncing now
All that bouncing, niggas ain't from the A-Town
We got Bankhead right here, southwest Atlanta too strong
(Break!)
