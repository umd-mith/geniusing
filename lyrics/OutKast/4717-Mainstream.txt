Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken
Words of a change I don't feel but I see
Visions from me
At twenty three making it free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from
M.L.K. to Cascade
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter keys, stacking G's
Knowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes its just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream
[Hook]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
They swan diving
Fit they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost, dog paddling, back stroking, what done happened?
Be rhyming "catch of the day" when the recipe calls for "blackened"
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens
and it's enticing how them Jones's sing
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this
but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
I let you stay in my crib, now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal, look at the hand you deal
Me crudball business nigga giving inches so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher
until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process sm-m-moking like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of conscience
Only to test, the potency
But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say
"I wish I never did what I did", now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin
and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10
Got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
Thats why, thats why, thats why
Everybody's a player, rubbing them Kangols on their head
Thinking its all about your clothes, nigga its all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family
up and down like hoes give head
every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish
