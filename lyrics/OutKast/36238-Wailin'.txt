In the zone like Keyser Söze
Always the Usual Suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies
Only the twenty piece mojo
Flows on like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street
Krush Groove and Breakin'
Never baking, rebuking Satan
We had you waiting
For the Second Coming, funny how time flies when you're rhyming
LaFace Records,
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffing that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries
OJ, not guilty, that's how they found he
I felt the pressure like sun shining
While raining at the same time
I kept on rhyming
Not complaining
Storm braining cats and dogs
My catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your Daisy Dukes
I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Rosco P. Col' people
Who caboose my locomotive
But enough of that, everyone can rap but let's say gift's a motive
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Compose won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop
You find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own, my speech is born
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy then I'm happy
Even if you just hate my fucking guts go 'head and dap me
'Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway
And then go home and pray for your ass later
'Cause we might need you in this war, I'm wailing on you traitors
Like that
