Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day,
me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbing every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy, you sounding silly, think my Brougham ain't sittin' pretty
Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties
But us gon' bust you in the mouth with the chorus now
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' with it
But I'm witchya 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt went on out and bought it
'Cause I thought it would be jammin' but examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she wrote
And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, "It's weak" is the last quote
That I want to hear when I'm goin' down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, "Them niggas earned that crown", but until then
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
[Harmonica Solo: Pastor Robert Hodo]
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
We the type of people make the club get crunk
