Caroline (Caroline)
See, Caroline, all the guys would say
She's mighty fine (mighty fine)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere
Half the time
And the other half either got you
Cussed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this
Now even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator
To divide (to divide)
The time it took to look inside
And realize
That real guys go for real
Down to Mars girls
Haha, yeah
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Caroline, (Caroline)
See she's the reason for the word
Bitch (bitch)
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror
And crash, crash
Crash into a ditch
Just playing
She needs a golden calculator
To divide (to divide)
That real guys go for real
Down to Mars girls
Yeah
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, I
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped,
dropping names she's weak
must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, I
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasing cars
What happens when the dough gets low
Bitch, you ain't that fine, no way
No way
No way
Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasing cars
What happens when the dough gets low
Bitch, you ain't that fine, no way
No way
No way
Crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
(Bitch) Crazy bitch
(Stupid ass bitch) Crazy bitch
(Old punk-ass bitch) Crazy bitch
(Old dumb-ass bitch) Crazy bitch
(A bitch's bitch) Crazy bitch
(Just a bitch) Crazy bitch
(Stupid ass bitch) Crazy bitch
(Old punk-ass bitch) Crazy bitch
(Old dumb-ass bitch) Crazy bitch
(A bitch's bitch) Crazy bitch
(Just a bitch)
