Either wish me well, go to hell
or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealing with ain't nutty
the study going to unveil
My relative in jail (Ha) stay engaged
To whatever make money, now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever rapper but I'm tangled in my cord (hum)
Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat!
The damsel's in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they getting warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you'll make it right
But hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king
Respect is mandatory, end of the story, go fly a kite
Category, ain't got none, you know I'm right

Congratulations, I'm a player
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal
criminal minded
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone filling out this application
An estimate is needed for your underestimation
I'm firing on the spot, go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle I've been patiently waitin'
Now that's a virtue; 'cause pussy nigga, I'll hurt you
'Cause you're trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go 'head recycle, repackage then put it back in my cabinet
Boy, that's germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga the B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around, I'm right after Martin Luther
No J R period senior 'cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
As a matter of fact, not fiction
Rumpelstiltskin, you wack
The worse thing since crack cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government, oh I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobody's slow
Mighty-I-dee-I-dee-I (Mighty-I-dee-I-dee-I)
Odee odee odee oooo (Ode odee odee oooo)
Mighty-I-dee-I-dee-I (Mighty-I-dee-I-dee-I)
Odee odee odee oooooo
