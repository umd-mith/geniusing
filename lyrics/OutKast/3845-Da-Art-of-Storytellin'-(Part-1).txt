Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs
in a Beamer 840
It's foggy
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though
maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too"
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Llac now
We just shoot game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Llac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now
