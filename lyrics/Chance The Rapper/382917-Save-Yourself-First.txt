[Intro: James Blake]
Love is the life 'round here
We're never done

Part time love
Life ain't been 'round here in a minute
Here ain't been 'round my whole life
Mike ain't spin 'round in a minute
The sand just dropped for the last time
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
Light ain't been 'round here in a minute
Darkness been swallowed it up
Chaos been 'round for a minute
Marketed, bottled it up
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
I ain't been 'round here in a minute
But here ain't been round a whole lot
My flesh looked through the peephole
Seen his people, sealed the keyhole and kept the door locked
Life can't be here, indefinite
Not another minute 'round here
Why can't a minute be spent in a town that's nowhere round here?
But wear that fake smile like a cape
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
