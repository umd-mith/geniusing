In the real world, we just people with ideas
In the real world, we just people with ideas
In the real world, we just people with ideas
In the real world, we just people with ideas
That shit cray, that shit dead
that shit fake, blast a kid
Cassius Clay at his head
atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need a Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking what up, I said on my soul I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end
The others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands
My momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting
I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas
I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I’m going to war with fate and I’m going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers cuz all the reporters lied
I call him my lil homie he brought him a .45
Brown boys are dying, and none of ‘em were for business
And all of em' love they mommas, and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive
[Outro]
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
(And now for something completely different)
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And hoping that I find you
I been hoping that I find you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
