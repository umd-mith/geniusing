Hey Ma, Hey Ma I know I never did behave a lot
Never got good grades a lot
And turned your hairs to grays a lot
And go in stores and take a lot
And never shopped but saved a lot
So you ain't gotta shop at Save A Lot
And you ain't gotta worry about Chase a lot
They playing with your checks, your shit
Que Sera, gotta then, fuck them niggas you smarter than
Save Money
, my partner and them
I'm part of them, It's part of me
This Save Mula, Bo Squad at three
I'm riding around my side of town
Hot boxing no cops around
I had the tux I had the gown
Just had a show, just had to bounce
It's Chance ho, #10Day
Chano no hable englais
That language be that chanish but ooh!
Muy caliente
So she just gonna throw her steps on
And haters gonna throw that epsom
And I'm gonna just throw my teflon
But twin bro be that Victor
And Big Cuz be that Chef Sean
