[Produced by Beirut]
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
[Verse 1]
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy’s a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain’t been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don’t think I felt ya hand on my head yelling “Call his father”
But people don’t hear ghosts so how they gon' blame me
Money saved me so I’ma do the same thing
You droppin pounds, gettin small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don’t know how to use a stick shift
You better not miss this, overdose, dope and mixes
Let ya throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it
Blast off...
Dropping tapes 'til I losted count
coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling I’m Boston bound
bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I’m jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib I’m falling down
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round
I’m calling out to God
Your little angels falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around
Oh non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh je t'assure que ce n'est pas grave
Non laisse moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent. Vous ne pensez qu'à ça
Well it’s been a long time, long time now
Since I’ve seen you smile
Said it’s been a long time, long time now, now, now
Said it’s been a long time, long time now
And it’s been a long time, long time now
