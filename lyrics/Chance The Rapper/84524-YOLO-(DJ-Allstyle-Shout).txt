[Intro: Chance the Rapper]
Yolo Clark, yolo car radio
Look me up in the yolo pages nigga
Hey, Ya!
When the fuck you gonna grow up?
When that money gonna show up?
Thought that 10 Day shit would blow up
Got you stressed, ripping your 'fro up
Smokin' squares, fuckin' your throat up
And a nigga from your iPod in the party and they know ya
And your teachers wanna claim ya, they critically acclaim ya
Used to criticize your mistakes
"Mr. Bennett's Mr. Famous"
Mrs. Rownd just heard your mixtape
"the misogynistic mischief"
You the reason for the mishaps
and should keep coming up missing
You're a top dog; you the top, dog
They can't even catch up; you so hot, dog
And it feels good, and it feels dope
You still steal shit, cause you still broke
And you really wanna drop, really really hot
Shit that they really wanna cop
but they wouldn't give a fuck
If you won a Grammy, if you end up in the Hall of Rock
Then you end up in a hole from a hammy to the top
Got 99 problems, got a 100 to the drugs
I should finish up this verse, but you know I don't give a fuck
YOLO!
Yo-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, YOLO (x5)
Shouts out my juice, bitch, my cup runneth over
Bout now them suits fit, my cuffs button golden
So bitch suck my dick, igh, bitch, suck my dack
I been riding 'round in that steamer with that steamer in my lap
I swear I used to give a fuck, but now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? What do you think of fuck fest?
You ever had a foursome? You ever been a suspect?
You ever passed the fuck out? You ever failed a drug test?
I learned from getting bumped that bumping Ye could make it be okay
All that jumping, dunking shit can't make a 3 go way
I been up inside the stu' for fucking three whole days
Yelling, "Fuck the cops, it ain't nothing to box"
So somebody pour me another shot like SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS,
Drop, drop, drop, drop
Give a fuck
bop, bop, bop
Don't stop, stop, stop, stop
