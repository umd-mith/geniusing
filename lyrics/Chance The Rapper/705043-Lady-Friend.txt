I've got a lady, a lady friend
I've got a lady friend
I've got a lady and that lady is my
I've got a lady, I've got, I've got a lady
And that lady is my friend
I've got, I've got a lady for a friend
I'm your buddy, I'm your little bro
I'm a stuffed animal
I'm a cuddle, not a dildo
I'm a love anecdote
Was I always taller than ya?
Will I always call ya back?
I'mma always wrongly answer
Always almost caught ya trap
Imaginary beneficiary been away for so long, Ben & Jerry friend
Few compliments and a tear wipe
I'm the best man you're not marrying
And you know they ask about you, "What's up with your lady?"
I tell 'em, "You're just, you're just, you're just gorgeous"
You're just a lady friend, a lady friend
For a friend, for a friend
What would you do?
For for a friend
What would you do for a friend?
