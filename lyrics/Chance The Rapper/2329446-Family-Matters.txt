All
All, all, all
All the things
All the things, things
All that glitters is not gold
All, all, all, and all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me
How's everybody doing?
We were all that matters, family's all that matters
This is just business, see you right after
Nothing comes before ya, nothing else matters
All of this is for ya, you are all that matters
I dance around the darkness down on Billie Jean Road
If I ain’t toured then we still’d be broke
Thought I got the formula, bon appetite
I got a beat in case my baby baba ever leak
Wise beyond my years but way behind my peak
You gotta eat, this a step to my princess
Point of interest, fourth and inches
Hallelujah, the kid grew up, the crowd cheered the child
Booya, mic drop, I walk home
I don't care about, they don't mean a thing (All, all)
All these fancy things (All, all)
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All)
All I know, I know (And all gold is not reality)
All these things
All these things
All these things
All these things
In this part of my life, I'm growing up and I- and I wanna, I wanna do this the right way, go, go out of it, grow out of it, in the best way possible, so thank you guys who's been there thus far, and it's only gonna get better...
I don't care bout, they don't mean a thing
All these fancy things
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All that glitters, glitters)
All I know, I know (Is not gold, Igh!)
