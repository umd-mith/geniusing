[Intro]
It just don't get better
It don't get better
It just don't get no better

[Hook]
It don't get no better
It don't get no
It don't get no better
It just don't get no better
[Verse 1]
I hate my bed, I hate my home, I hate my job
I hate the wife, I hate the kids, I hate the dog
I hate the sun, I hate the rain, I hate the clouds
I hate the TV, hate the dinner, hate the couch
I hate the car, I hate the bus, I hate the road
I hate the bar, I hate to drink, I hate to smoke
I hate a stranger, hate his boss, I hate his friend
I hate the womb, I needed room, I ate my twin
I hate my hands, handshakes, pancakes, milkshakes
Child-resistant locks on the pill case
I hate inflation, hate the store
I hate to choose
I hate the war, I hate the poor, I hate the news
I hate the late, I can't be early, hate to wait
I hate my lovers cause the way they suffocate
I fuck to hurt, it hurt to date, I hate to date
I fuck to hate, I hate to love, I hate to hate
[Bridge X3]
And it just don't

[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I hate to lose, I hate to try, I hate to win
I hate to cruise, I hate to fly, I hate to swim
I hate the optimistic smirks on the face of children
I hate the government and those who deface its buildings
I hate artists, hate creatives, I hate bright people
I hate darkness, I hate racists, I hate white people
I hate small speakers, I hate loud speakers
I hate great concerts,
I don't like crowds neither
I hate money, I hate change, I hate hope
I hate funny, I hate strange, I hate dope
I hate charities and parodies and tragedies
I hate carrots, peas, asparagus
Virtually all vegetables, circuses, all festivals
Texts that are oversexual, motion because it's perpetual
I hate schedules, calendars, reminders cause' they just remind us
That tomorrow gon' be just as timeless
I fuckin' hate you
[Bridge + Hook]
