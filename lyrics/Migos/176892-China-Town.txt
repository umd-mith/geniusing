Black shades, Johnny Cage, diamonds go parade
(Chirp! Chirp!)
Motorola in the kitchen
whippin' Sonya
My plug look like Pacquiao
his daughter is Kitana
China Town, China Town, China Town, China Town
Young rich nigga I got plugs out in China Town
China Town, China Town, China Town, China Town
Young rich nigga I got plugs out in China Town
Sellin' that dope to the leems and lames, I pull up and I'm in your lane
Got a main bitch, no name
My main plug, name Fang
He choppin' them bricks and remixin' them chickens
He front me the work, now I got a ticket
I got the birds singing like I'm Richie Lionel, I mean Lionel Richie
Finessing the plug, again I did it
My life is expensive
you flexing the rental
Erasing the work, like a #2 pencil
You a rat in the hood, Stuart Little
I'm blowing on gas like a fiddle
Young nigga in the hood selling nickels
white boys keep the ice Popsicles
Flip the work, like a acrobat, doing jumping jacks
J's sniff the work off the plate, had a heart attack
Whippin' the coca, no cola
You want it, just hit me on my Motorola
My diamonds are yellow corona
I'm selling that Princess Fiona
I'm smoking that gas with Obama
I pull up in Zondas, you pull up in Hondas
I laugh at you clowns, Ronald Mcdonald,
choppin' a ton of Osama
Mr. Miyagi my plug, I make all the profit, for checkin' his nasi
I'm feeling like Christopher Wallace, Versace, Versace, Versace
All these damn plugs, and young Takeoff I'm the socket
Beat that pot, Bernard Hopkins, I got flavor Baskin-Robbins
I'm fuckin' Kitana, you know I got Sonya, for days
My diamonds they kick Johnny Cage, Quentin Jackson Rampage
Plug out in China Town, hit my cell and said he got that shrimp fried rice
He drop the prices by the pound in China Town
