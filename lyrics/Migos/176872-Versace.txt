[Verse 1: Drake]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changin'
‘Cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wantin' a verse for a verse
But man, that's not a swap to me
Drownin' in compliments
Pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
Man, I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto, but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talking 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace
We stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows Versace, the sheets are Versace
I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world
Like, "What the fuck is he plannin'?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
‘Cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label,
the album is comin'
September, just wait on it
This year I'm eatin' your food
And my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house
I sit back, like, "Damn, I look great on it."
I do not fuck with your new shit
My nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo
Man, this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelings, ‘cause business is business
It's strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it
Man, that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York
‘Cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out
Where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me
[Hook: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
I know that you like it, Versace
My neck and my wrist is so sloppy
Versace, Versace, I love it, Versace the top of my Audi
My plug, he John Gotti
He give me the ducks, I know that they're mighty
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "Versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't never been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga, don't fumble
[Hook: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
You can do Truey, I do it Versace
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Cookin' this dope like I work at Hibachi
These niggas, they wishin' they knew you
They coppin' the Truey, remixin' the Louis
My blunts is fat as Rasputia
In a striped shirt like I’m Tony the Tiger
I’m beatin' the pot; call me Michael
Lot of you niggas that copy
Look at my closet, Versace, Versace
[Hook: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi
You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body
Young Offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
You know that I’m livin'
I’m draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs; that’s Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I’m the don, but no Rocco
This the life that I chose
Bought out the store, can’t go back no more
Versace my clothes while I’m sellin' them bows
Versace take over, it took out my soul
[Hook: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
