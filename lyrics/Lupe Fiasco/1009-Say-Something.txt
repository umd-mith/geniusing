Opus of a ghetto boy who grew into a project man
Brewster Place, he used to stick his scissors in his sockets damn
Clear that Project Runway
Cause this is where my rocket lands
Ain’t got no problems, Houston
Events recent that lit a fire under him like pots and pans
Rockets and
I
up in the sky like helicopter cams
And you down there in the traffic jam
From here I’ve seen a bunch of fake shit like avid wrestling fans
Came up from the bottom of the eye exam zoom
Now I’m like the biggest G up in the room
Still hard to see me like the truth on TV
Or the roof from the sidewalk
I don’t flow, I ceiling
Cause I’m made from the best stuff on earth
Like Snapple Tea Leaves
They glass is half full so I spit into them like Celie
No longer G, now you can see me
But your letter's still under my sea like seaweed
C and G
but nothing bout me CG
It’s all real, none of this is green screen
Shut Up and Let Me Go just like The Ting Tings
I’m feeling like a Mac
Standing around a bunch of PCs
I’ve rocked it from the shottas to the soccer moms
Try to stop what’s going on
You’ll see the back of my hand like the tops of palms
I’m balling like the tops of pawns
Circle of influence getting bigger like the ripples on the tops of ponds
Sure-footed and War Headed like the tops of bombs
Domino-in niggas
Delivery is Papa John's, Little Caesar's
Burning down your Pizza Hut
Plaque collection building cause
I don’t brush my teeth enough
Crack is wack
But this is like my weaker stuff
They ask is this his day-to-day cause this is like a week to us
Mic is shy and speakers blush
shy
and he is up
No we is up - cause its like two of me
And each of us rapping acid, eat this up
A-Town down, peace is up
New York to East Coast is cuffed
West Side riding
Lot of niggas' salty cause
Cause I be overseas and tough
WorldStar
never seen this
NahRight
gotta stream this, mother fucking
genius
Brave and fly, you backbone-less and wingless
Bunch of chickens on the strip
I’m coming for they fingers
Till what they throwing up is meaningless
Chilly Chill you seeing this
This didn’t make MTV’s list
Finish fingers, eating wrist, feeding frenzy and shit
Succotash suffering
Chicken-Frikasee'en this
A beat eating media blitz
Pace is getting feverish
Pain is growing Seaver-ish
These the peppers Peter picked
Things are at their easiest
Real Compton city G’in it
But I’m from Chicago, house lights bravo
