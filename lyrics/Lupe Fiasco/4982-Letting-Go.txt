[Instrumental and Percussion Intro]
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul (oh, woah oh, oh...)
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go (oh, woah, oh, oh...)
My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my old self I wonder if we still see alike
We was tight seeing lights
Speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high. Life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted, trying to fall asleep. Lost inside my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul (oh, woah oh, oh...)
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go (oh, woah, oh, oh...)
[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
I'm begging me don't let me go
We vow like the letter "O"
To never go our separate ways
And spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin'
Playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits
Livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow
Can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room the entry wound
Let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is
Unprepared and filterless
Magnify the youth in me,
alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers shootin' out of you and me
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul (oh, woah oh, oh...)
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go (oh, woah, oh, oh...)
Sometimes I feel like the world—
Sometimes I feel like the world is against me
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
Cause I don't wanna fight this war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This Uzi weighs a ton, but I think I'm done!
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul (oh, woah oh, oh...)
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go (oh, woah, oh, oh...)
[Outro: Sarah Green]
Think I'll be letting you go
Things are getting outta control
Said, it feels like I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
I think I'll be letting you go
Letting you go
