Fresh to def she is
From her steps to her set she is
So death might not let me live, ya dig
Fresh, uh-huh, yes she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind, don't play like this, naw
But I'm prepared for it, got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for light like that, then there go it
Yeah, right over there, so I prepared to pour it
Little scared, my stare lowered, momma said
have no fear
Plus I'm already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here for it
It's nothing, right
So here go it, whispered in her ear
It's kinda crowded in here would she care to blow it
And she said yeah
You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor
It's hard to get
In the car we sit
From the intro
She rolled down the window
Just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm, a little more confident
Uh huh, and then we lose consciousness
She says that I've been waiting for you
And I know you've been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from a castle
I've been thinking of you
I told a fire-breathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said, see too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine
You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
Relationship is just thirty minutes long
It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two,
before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me: out of the trillions
Of numbers that's in the world just leave me a few
That lead to you
Won't be long then, I'll see you in the morning
Cool
You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
