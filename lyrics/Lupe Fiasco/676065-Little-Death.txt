Now bring it out
Like a finger in the back of your mouth
Cherubs and cerebellum,
Tara at Sarah's wedding
Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't, well then you're wicked
Such is life
Odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals
Vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers...
[Hook 1: Nikki Jean]
How was your day, can I make what you say
What I wanna hear, cause I want you here
The hell that we raised to the heavens do anything for
La petite mort, la petite mort
They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like probably in the eye
What of the chicken? what is it missin', is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And the tension from its demise pulled all of the flavor from the fat
And made it flat and rather lifeless
Well there's a place that has a stunning turbot
And more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
How is your memory?
Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me
Or was it slippin' like permission, am I trippin' like field
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth
Maybe like kosher beef
Is it real, is it real, is it real
Ha, hah!
[Hook 2: Nikki Jean]
Howl at the day can I make you my prey
Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
Our petite mort, our petite mort
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The atelier slowly fills with baboons
That other monkey business
Where killers go free cause a junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter
[Hook 3: Nikki Jean]
How are your chains, do they make you behave
Keep you over here, by your overseer
Fallen from grace down from heaven to memories floor
La petite mort, la petite mort
