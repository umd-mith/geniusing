Sneakers beep a
heater underneath the seam
On the jeans every time I hit the scene
Like Mira
Look at me crook I be
Like ya neck
when you slept wrong
the American dream
Don’t step on the block that I run
Block that I brung the first beamer that they’d ever seen on these
Wit with the rocks I sling like David
Fee Fi Fo Fum
By nature I’m a hustla
Move pack like I move and I’m packing
Y’all niggas move back on the come up like elevator action
Welcome to the action-packed world of trapping
cook a key
If you chop the nickels that you can get a drop and a box of pistols
Have to get it cooked so you can not get little
Fast (echo)
Money (echo)
‘cause all my habits important
I kept the illest hoopers in high school and Jordans
Kept the illest rappers in the hood recording
See I keep it real no I no bluffin’
I got money but I no puff them
I re-up remove weight like liposuction
a little mackin and a little Cadillacin’
Rings gators on seen the suits when I sneak
Man I pack shit for a king
Such as I
Uh, uh you try
See haters try to touch they uh, uh deny
This is not for the weak of heart like John Q
You’re just a John to that blonde who wants you
I’m cut from a finer cloth
See it’s pimpin’ in my blood
Know how much that vagina costs
If a playa suspect the game gon’ reject him
Welcome to the world’s oldest profession
Most niggas lame cuz they can’t accept it
They can never understand so they can’t respect it
They can never feel my pain cuz they can’t connect with it
Fast (echo)
Money (echo)
Pimps up hoes down
Why you trying to get that ho to swallow
If you get a brain then the hoes will follow
Uh, I keep it real see I know pimpin’
I tell them what they want cuz I know women
They better have my cash or I go tripping
Now follow a playa as I go hustling
For that fast
