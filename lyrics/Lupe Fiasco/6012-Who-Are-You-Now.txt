Well, first she had on baby clothes
Then she had on young lady clothes
Mom tried to keep her out the sexy clothes
Prom night she wore dressy clothes
Took her all night to get ready for
Retro now she want 80′s clothes
Pregnant now its bigger clothes
Delivered now back in littler clothes
Different girl when the liquor flow
Stripper name
Stripper pose on stripper poles
Then take off her stripper clothes
Right in front them gigolos
Cocaine where she stick her nose
Burnt out,
turned out, bull dyke now she walk around in niggas' clothes
Turned out now she walk around in niggas clothes
Goodwill got to give her clothes
Oh the humanity, like that burning dirigible
Richard Pryor lit on fire
she can’t tell what fit no more
Who are you now?
It’s like everyday you change
Who are you now
Your style, your clothes, your name
Who are you now
So who are you now
Who are you now
Who are you now
So you spend all your time to fit in line
To fit in the crowd and
even in your mirror’s eyes
Yourself you can’t identify
And just like the Energizer rabbit
You just be spinning round
And as it intensifies, your life it de-materializes
Today’s stylings, injecting like a virus
From TV screens to your iris
You buy what you are provided with
Whatever your size is
You lay it flat then iron it
And if you fight it, its like David verse Goliath
Cause that skin you supposed to hide it
Dress it up and deny it
Can't even go natural no more cause if do you probably won't get hired
So tell me who’s lying
If I am, I’m lying
On the ground but I’m flying
And they still tryna find me
