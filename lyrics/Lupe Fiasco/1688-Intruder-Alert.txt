In the economic peckin' order
Emergency relief distribution systems is in disorder
He's checkin' water, makin' sure it's safe enough for his daughter
To float across in the boat he built
Hopefully strong enough to support her
Prayin' border patrols don't catch her ass
Process and deport her
Before she reach the shore, of the land of the free
Where they feed you, treat you like equals
Deceive you, stamp you and call you illegal

How could this be? I locked my doors
Kept my armies on my shore
I'm so fortified
I built my wall so high
So why oh why are there
