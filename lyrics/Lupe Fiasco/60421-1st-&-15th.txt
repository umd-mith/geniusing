Say is this home
Widely received, whenever I touchdown
Call me Young Touchdown, nothin' deeper than the end zone
I had a good year, like the blimp Ice Cube's a pimp on
I lips poem, the same blocks where I made everything rock like Flintstones
Drop with the rims on, clock with the gemstones
Can't call it like blocks on a Sprint phone
Flow incredible
remember, L-U-P-Emperor
Nickname December, move birds like winter
Mind on my tender, move words like verb
Drop lines like "enter"
Go on and get it Crunk
I ain't really gotta jump like centers
Wait, while you popping and panicking
Peep the demeanor that I'm standing in
Unfazed like I'm mocking a mannequin
Don't think its fluff cause the pampering
I'm still ruff like the unpaid man
Like the unpaved Madison
Straight where I stay like dogs that don't move
Obedient school made me so cool
I was so unruly
I used to chase cars, run behind female dogs
Wouldn't sit with shit
Now you cats can't move me
I'm a chaser
And niggas tryin' to take me off my paper
Like erasers
Let me put you on to somethin'
All I got is the other end for them
And their brother men that wanna get it bubblin'
It's nothing
So be clear
Like I'll pretend that me here
Not just help a friend, believe it
But if you feel you need it
Then I can be your last one like Jesus
You could be as hard as sign language with no fingers
And you'll never forget, like elephants
Thought you had yourself a slippa, like Cinderella prince
But instead you got yourself pimpa
Who wasn't hesitant to help yo limp like impotence Jack
Viagra to be more exact, Emperor to Emgera
Perhaps I rap to much on the issue
It's back to my ritual
We'll be back
If I happen to miss you
Clappin' the pistol
Burning like clap when you piss dude
Laughin' a little
