It's some fresh new Vans on my fresh new plans
Obama lied to you you nigga no you can't, ha
shout to Fox news tryin' ta change me up
Sorry Uncle Rush but I still don't vote
Cause niggas on the ballot and there's still no hope
So I'm back in the hood, Englewood to Inglewood
Doin' work that politician should, good
Just tryin' to make you smart when I make my art
Occupy forever, more tents to the park
Howard Zinn gettin' spins in the Benz
If it's not him, it' NPR, Diane Rehms
Kai Ryssdal, Amy Goodman
Sorry Bill O'Reilly but I'm so involved
Can you ask Limbaugh to return my calls
Yeah, Atlantic on the fritz
Cause I might not step foot back in that bitch
Jerry Sandusky
Goodness gracious pedophiles and rapists, in high places
Not to mention slavery and slave ships
Tell Jerry's cellmate try and keep it out his ass
What happened to the class? All the low blows
As long as y'all win you can still put it in
Yup, hip hop back with a vengeance
Spirit of Chuck D with a whole lot of interest
Just inches from the entrance
Not to knock nice, but to knock it off the hinges, huh
I'm just playin', I'm just playin'
You know I like y'all
Well, some of y'all
But you know who I'm talking to, I rock with y'all
You know we do it big
Atlantic records First and Fifteenth all day
Yeah, let's go
SNDCLSH in Vegas,
only dropping those new Kaskade hits
Let's see how crazy the rave gets
Might play my 2Pac favorites
Me and Sky back in the Labs
Shout to Bassnec
count all that cash
Whatever you do, don't drop that flag
Watch is stll gold, chain is still gold
Feelin' brand new, Ferrari still old
Got the dreads cause Marley still cold
GTR my car be real slow
Nah my car be real close
To the speed of the light when I be on roads
Flow like I be on roids and I be on ten when I be on tour
