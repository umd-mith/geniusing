[Intro: Matthew Santos]
[Hook: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
Thought I left you alone
But look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
Well, well
Is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns, a little altered
Your attention, put back on the flow like the department of water
Taking off with the dough, like Little Walter
Chess, yes, baby I’m Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with the lawyer
Judge, jury, like a loop
Rap name Lupe, but my daddy named me warrior
This is his memorial,
[Hook: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
Thought I left you alone
But look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
No, I ain’t that nigga trying to get a liquor line
When I be scripting lines, want this petition signed
It says I’m sick of dying, sick of this prison time
I really love my people, I’m sick of pimping mine
Now if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed fat bitch
Telling us not to pursue it, just to shoe it like a blacksmith
We’re trapped, and moving round in circles like it’s Chapstick
And that’s the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
We’ll wrap this around your head like the bandanas Fabolous
Used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in FEDS instead of National Geographics
Well, I’m not having it
[Hook: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
Thought I left you alone
But look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain’t never heard mine
And if you have, then you know you ain’t never heard lying
Lu don’t move no cowards, you only heard lines
Not a facade cherisher, I’d rather have the scars
I don’t idolize America, I’m dancing with the stars
You look up and you see us shining down on you
[Hook: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
Thought I left you alone
But look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
