Today, nobody cares
But tomorrow, they will
Today, nobody cares
But oh tomorrow, they will
They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
I get my energy from my inner G
I be in outer space but I got inner peace
So tell my enemies that they can't injure me
I know that irritate, you have my sympathies
Well you should protest
yeah you should picket me
I'm on a losing strike, I'm on a winning streak
I'm out at left field, I'm speaking mentally
But that's a better place than where the benches be
I'm feeling really good, me and my different beat
Me and my different drummer
he play the timpanis
See that's what got me here, you hearing me
Me on my "black man in the future" shit, call me Billy Dee
See I'm just forward looking, that's how I really see
See while you Valentines, I'm thinking Christmas trees
And that's how this would be even at Micky D's
Semi-colon, closed parentheses
They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
Do you remember me, the guy from verse one
Failure's my last name, Never's my first one
You see I hood a lot,
and yeah I nerd some
Hood's where the heart is
nerd's where the words from
Don't represent either because I merged them
It's kids who wanna leave and I encourage them
Go out and see the world, never return from
Yeah you don't come back unless you learned some
And baby girl what does it matter where your purse from
Your hair done, your nails did, your ass fat but you're dumb
Mix Melissa Ford with Maya Angelou
Become a top model and Sojourner too
I try to follow this, what Muhammad do
It's such an old soul, inside this sonic youth
It's why I'm Ferrari'd up
and I'm conscious too
I don't prophesize, I promise you
They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
Yeah it's me again, the guy from verse two
Well this the last one, it's almost curfew
It's almost night out so turn ya lights on
Where all my 760s with ya brights on
Yeah they are the ones to keep your eyes on
Like how we used to do to keep the house warm
Now those the type of eyes I not cry from
You see the tears of fire run out my crying songs
Now the world shoulders is what I'm crying on
The world's fast lane is what I'm driving on
What am I driving at,
trying to drive it home
I'm in the drivers seat but you can ride along
It's never cyclops, it's never I alone
I'm telling your story wherever I perform
Out in the bright lights right where I belong
