[Verse 1]
I bring you murder in the first
And even as we speak we getting further in this verse
With no further ado I do what I respect
Doom got me stripes like Hamburgler for my work
Mercy, he's a mess, so immersed in his murk
He's 2/3 submerged below the surface where they surf
This is where I lay it down like a bird giving birth
So call me "Lu the Giant's Goose" or just "Faberge paint"
Til I'm called back to the shore by the watchers of the bay
I wait, til I come back like a tsunami
Never microwave like the watchers of the weight
I'm wrapped in aluminum foil, I do my dirt like Kwame
Until that same soil being pushed into my grave
Might strike oil while I delay, homie I'm so crude
Texas T, haters is so screwed
But I can't fill it like a flathead in a Philips
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm no tool
More cool than a pool in a blizzard
With ice cubes in it during Christmas
Meanin' there's no school,
I'm the misfit
Like I'm throwin' a fit
Or I just can't fit it, tidbit too big
It's gotta hem it til it's fresh to death
Dressed to kill it
Uh, 187 on my second, I reckon
This is an assault with a deadly session
A soft peace and blessings to the sentence that be reppin
All across in every direction, locality, and section
most niggas won't believe
Or achieve how I did it most niggas won't receive
'Til I leave and I bereave the secrets of my sickness
How I, flooded the streets like Venice
I'm Colonel Mustard with the speech
They ain't catchin' me, no suspicions of stickin'
No convictions on my rap sheet
I'm so committing lay my murder game,that's sweet
Speakeasy like Prohibition, no admission
If you ain't knocking like me to the underground bar, burying a toast
Dodging the raid like roach, nigga please
Uh, I make it give up the ghost
On the trifecta, the third, I differ
Nigga, you ain't heard, my lecture like Lector
Letchya in on a secret, but you can't leak it
Since my entrance, my niggas had packs
They moved em to a trap like Winston
Far from bustas, baby nah
All my homies henchmen
I was the rhymer, my talk went through the walls like Slimer
Or like, eating vagina
Or, a stray bullet, whichever ways I put it
Crooks was hooked like crooks through neighborhoods I pushed it
Little Caesar niggas pizzas was like "book it"
Delivery mean like Leroy Green
