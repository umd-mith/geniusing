DROGAS, yeah
THOT 97
THOT 97, nigga
Masterpiece
Threaten these niggas like the bad police
This the word of God from the pastor cheeks
And you can take a bath in the wrath of leaks,
surf,
baptize
Give a nigga my rap ties, metaphor, reservoir dog got cat lives
You can flip a coin, heads or tails, my nigga, bet it lands on the flat side
Always be a winner
You can be a Mac, nigga, I'mma be a printer
You can be a fat nigga, I'mma be a sprinter
Top of the world, nigga, you can ask Kenna
But trees got them paper nigga, timber
Timber timber timber
Timber timber timber
You gotta have principles, Skinner, Skinner
Or I'mma be the fat nigga, treat the finish line like a dinner time
And put on for my city like a Windy City wintertime
For as long as a one nigga wanna feel a really pretty titty line
Now let's say I get carjacked
Niggas like, "That's your new shit? Got that from who, shit? That look like Lu shit"
Then they bring the car back like it's Enterprise
Turnt when I was 18,
had to start attackin' when I was 25
Nigga had the 9 at 14,
I had the super V when I was 29
And I keep 30 in the 34,
and I can hit the 10 like 20 times
Nigga had the fifties by the tubes,
and you can count to 10 'bout 20 times!
THOT 97, THOT 97
That's a hundred-round clip and I shot 97
And I shot 90 weapons, what it doin'?
THOT 97, hundred in the chain and the watch 97
And I keep it hunnid like three more
And I'm feelin' like a boss, like Ebro
THOT 97, the coupe brand new but the drop from '97
I treat your top 10 like my bottom 97
Man I was in the trap house, nigga, watchin' 9-11
Real shit, ain't see the first one hit, but I watched 'em fly the second
Beats get slayed, like a nigga flyin' presents
Who put the flyest tapes in your fireplace?
I'mma tell you now, nigga, I ain't even tryna wait
Nigga 'fore you waste my time, I'mma tell you right now
Fahrenheit had niggas on the fire 'scapes, woo!
Superman, Batman, Space Ghost, Mighty Mouse, nigga all kinda capes
Tetsuo Season drop when it drop,
nigga I don't even know the date
That's a hundred-round clip and I shot 97
what we doin'?
THOT 97, THOT 97
And I keep it hunnid like three more
Feelin' like a boss, like Ebro
