THOT 97, nigga
30 keys, 100 keys, janitor
Your nigga's a star
But the police is his manager
And he got a dope bitch
And her favorite rapper from Canada
But she snitching too
In her Gucci bag is that camera
Like oh no, oh no
What you tell that bitch?
Oh no, oh no
What you show that bitch?
Oh no, oh no
Why you look so sick?
Oh no, oh no
Cause it's over with
She's down with ya, wore the crown with ya
They roped her in with some old shit
Credit card fraud back in '06
She was gettin mad and unfocused
Their trump card is some ho shit
They told her that they take kids
And that's when she folded
Exploded, exposed it
Everything that she noticed
Prosecutors was watching
Through the mirror while she told this
That's the case nigga, let's close this
Still gave her time and that's bogus
She was in the car when they pulled up
And popped trunk and unloaded like
There's good niggas, bad weakness
He's talking bout who they sleep with
He killed a nigga in a heartbeat
But he couldn't keep no secrets
He's no good for your defenses
He's steady with that chopper
When them cops got him in that precinct
That's when he fell to pieces
Name all in those papers
Signed a recording deal with them majors
He's confirming all of your capers
While you's dropping down all that data
Tryna get right with his saviours
He was giving life to his neighbors
Just like CPR, oh my god
Goodness, gracious
In the stripclub with them agents
Not the ones that was taking pictures
But that main one that you came with
Showin off all his entertainment
He was recording all of your statements
He was taking all of your payments
Right back to the evidence room
While you was booing all in his faces
You was losing all of your cases, losing all of your cases
You was winning with them bitches but you was losing all of your cases
Ain't no rules at all in the Matrix
Ain't no truth and ain't nothin sacred
Know you're the only one with that paper
People moving all in your places
Looking for
