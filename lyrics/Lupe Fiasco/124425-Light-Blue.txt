Since a shorty I was 40 and my 40's is like 80's
So by the time I die, I'm gon' be a baby
And so my youth sound just like lightning coming down
See my youth sound just like lightning coming down
And my youth sound just like lightning coming down
And my youth sound just like lightning coming down
From my view here, my hue veers
To a blue smeer on a white wall, what you might call my blue period
I'm two-tiered, but no tats, and I don't know what you call that
Goes on and on like two mirrors
And if you see us then you read properly
then your heart knows
And your head copies
My two tears, ain't no dead bodies
They my entendres and I'm hungry
So my piece of the pie better be as big as Mahatma Gandhi's
Even my filler kills
my 13th just might be a zombie
So thrilling at bringing all that filling back
So if you died lately
put your trust in the cry baby
Free man don't drive Daisy,
but that light I shed so hydrate
In my hot rod with my Vans on and my hand bone
And my hair long and
my circle tight and my square strong
I'm in great shape with no shake-weights
Or no weight shakes and tell your mama this cake's great
Cake cake cake cake cake cake cake
And not Rihanna, my cake's paper
I rage in Harlem
I paper bait
asses
Before I leave like Cassius Clay
In that big ole car, that bass shake that little bars
So my bass tape and that Drake Go
if ya wanna wake-o then Jaco’s!
Where the cake go? I blew all that for this great flow
Wish a nigga would step on this Pergo that I paid for
Red lights, obey my headlights
That head red like peg,
or Santa's sled lights
That mean I heard what she said 'fo she said what she said outta head
It's like I got a head mic'd
Like a Fed might, but I ain't fed like
Been a hands on homie, my head right
Dreadlocks, but no Red Stripe
and that both ours like red bike
And the Feds know what I roll like
In a dead man, with some low-lifes
Me stopped, then your lights
I got no lights 'til the stop-sign
I got no rights like Nascar
Or a black man in the deep south
Doin' Jim Crow with the police
That's 99 problems with a ho twice
From no life to Frankenstein, got it stitched up I'm so nice
