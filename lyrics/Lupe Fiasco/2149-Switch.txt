Switch
You you you, yes let the words woo you
Till you woozy
Let the lyrics subdue you
Massage and soothe you
Move you till conscience lose you
Lu now rules you
You do what Lu do and you'll do beautiful
I'm the meanest
You the meanest?
I'm the meanest
And I mean this
Now I don't mean this
To sound fiendish
But I'm a genius
You a genius?
And the cleanest
Never seen this
As clean as
My cleanest
From on top
From underneath
From behind
Or in between
Switch
I'm a hustler creeping with my hat low
Niggas know I pack so
What they gonna do that for?
Niggas got my back though
Like answering the back door
Catch you I'm a slap you, leave you redder than the bat phone
Switch
With a little bit of this and a little bit of that
That
Mixed with a little bit of pimp
And a little bit of mac
And a little bit of limp
And a whole lotta gangster lean
I can't be seen
I ain't the King, but a nigga is strengthening
To paint the scene
And take the thing over
Like a soldier, colder than a polar, Got the hood like a cobra, nigga thank the team

Switch!
I switch like hydraulic cars
Switch like DeBarge, nigga.
Murder niggas
Step on my shoes I hurt a nigga
Kill a nigga
Fill a nigga with holes
Call women hoes
Hold up niggas, hold up hoes
Break the calm, detonate bombs
Blow up niggas, blow up hoes
Turn around, smack they moms
Switch
Heal niggas
Educate and build niggas
Instill in niggas it’s real to respect women
Treat'em like they real
They feel, nigga
Watch the birds
Watch Dr. Phil, nigga
Chill, nigga
Go learn a skill, nigga
Switch
Rims, Mercedes Benz, twenties, twenty-twos, twenty-fours, rose gold, platinum watches, cases of Mo'
Gucci, rubies, mansions, models, VIP, Ferraris, chinchillas, diamond rings, change, Range Rovers, bling bling
Niggas bust his trains
Pocket full of change
Dimes, quarters, taking orders
Delivering pizzas
Air conditionless, beaters
Hand-me-down sneakers
Silver
Wannabe models won't show me love
And I can't get in the club
Hey hey hey, it's coming back to you
Lu no longer rules you
You can do what you do
Back to your usual
It's official
It's official
I'm official
As officials
Who got the stripes
And the flags
And the whistles
Whistle and watch my niggas come
From the underground
Just like Thriller play Bambi
And you gonna hear that thumper sound
They can't touch the sound
That I'm busting now
It's like a cloud trying to touch the ground
Jealous niggas catch your feelings cuz I'm hustling now
What?
Switch
They be hating
Switch
They be hating
Switch
What? What? What?
They be hating
Don't give them stage
That you got a cousin that don't mind catching cases
Busting niggas' heads in, slapping niggas' faces
And he a do it
He a do it
He a do it
And I'll prove it
Cuz I didn't seen it
You didn't seen it?
I'd a seen it
He the meanest
That's why this thing is fiendish
