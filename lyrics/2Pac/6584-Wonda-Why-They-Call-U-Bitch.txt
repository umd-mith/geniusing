You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
Look here, Miss Thang, hate to salt your game
But you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
High fives ‘cause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need, see
It's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me ‘cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout to get tossed up
Still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin' to get rich
I love you like a sister, but you need to switch
And that's why they called you bitch—I betcha!
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You leave your kids with your mama
‘Cause your headin' for the club
In a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
Got them legs wide open
I pass by, can't hold back tears inside
‘Cause Lord knows, for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
It's like your mind don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
And niggas wouldn't call you bitch—I betcha!
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
‘Cause hey now, got a baby on the way now
More money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
You're about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date, can't be late
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
I should've never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change, ‘cause you don't look the same
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now?
‘Cause everybody left
They stepped, and left you on your own
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
Dear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me
Fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know, why we call them hoes bitches
And maybe this might help you understand
It ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business
So If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
