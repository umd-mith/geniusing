It's that new 'Pac, y'all
Pac's life
(Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
(It's 2Pac the king)
What do you know about Pac's life
(Only real niggas stay on top)
(Outlawz)
Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a mad man nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits
Picture a high school drop out
Rollin' a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change
It comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night
Why's everybody caught up in Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas, conversating on my life
Mind your motherfucking business
I remember that
Ay
What's happening Pac
Yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through
Meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see
Now they all in the court room blaming me
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's
With the same sort of dude with the same short fuse
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass
Nigga you scary, I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers, in Junior High
I was itching' to kill, and you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'mma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd
and motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top
Why are all you niggas all up in my shit?
Tell them motherfucker's
Outlawz
Fuck all y'all
