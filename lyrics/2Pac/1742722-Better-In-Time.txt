Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
These silly bitches got this game twisted
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
