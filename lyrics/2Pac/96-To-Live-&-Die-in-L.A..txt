[Intro]
“Street Science, you’re on the air. What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac’s new one?”
“I love 2Pac’s new record.”
“Right, but don’t you feel like that creates tension between East and West?
I mean, he’s talking about killing people,
‘I had sex with your wife’ — and not in those words.
But he’s talking about, ‘I wanna see you deceased’…"
2Pac
To live and die in L.A.
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
Who was a friend is now a ghost in the dark
Cold-hearted 'bout it,
nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson,
court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words,
writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell,
to live and die in L.A. on bail
My angel sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A.
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
It's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama, like a soap opera,
on the curb
Watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear, the pen right across from hell
I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats,
these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this:
we'll burn this bitch down
Get us pissed,
to live and die in L.A
My angel sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A.
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, brown pride, and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember K-day? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at?
shermed out
M.O.B.,
Big Suge in the Lo-Lo,
bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B.
Neckbone, Tray, Heron, Big Buntry too
Big Rock
got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angel sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A.
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
Let my angel sing
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin' my shit
Makin' my shit sells
katruple quitraple platinum
This go out to all the magazines that support a nigga
A&R
L.A., "California Love" part mothafuckin' two
Without gay ass Dre
