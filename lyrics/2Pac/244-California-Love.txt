[Hook: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Dre putting it down for Californ-i-a
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player
where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally
to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing, but have caution:
we collide with other crews
Worldwide,
let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
, it's Westside
So you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down
Give me love!
South Central
[Ad-Libs: Dr. Dre]
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco
And you know L.A. up in here
Pasadena where you at?
Inglewood
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?
Throw it up ya'll, throw it up, throw it up!
