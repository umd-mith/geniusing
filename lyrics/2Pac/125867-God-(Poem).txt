when I was alone and had nothing
I asked 4 a friend 2 help me bear the
pain no one came except . . . God
when I needed a breath 2 rise
from my sleep no one could
help me except . . . God
when all I saw was sadness
and I needed answers no one
heard me except . . . . God
so when I'm asked who I
give my unconditional love 2
Look For No other Name
except . . . GOD!
