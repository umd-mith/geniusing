Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Y'knahmean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times,
I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days,
promise to hold on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace
And even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place
The players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: "Home is where the heart is."
Dear departed,
I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
Is there a spot for us to roll? If you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream, "Peace!"
While the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps
With Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown; tell the lady in the liquor store
That she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky
