If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit, reminisce thinking a bliss of the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em
They tested it was stress that they under
We never really went through that
Cause we was born B.C. - you and me before crack
And nowadays things changed
Everyone's ashamed of the youth cause the truth look - strange
And for me it's reversed
We left them a world that's cursed and it - hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all condemned like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't it make em get teary
The world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There is no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white cause we're human
I hope we'll see the light before it's ruined
My Ghetto Gospel
Who ever said that this trouble would stop today
A lot of niggas get locked away
Teenage women growing up with AID's
Cause that's the life when your living in the
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in the
Ghetto
That's the life when your living in the
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in the
Ghetto
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out of bags but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy, well guess who's giving birth to a baby
I don't trip to let her fade me
From outta the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
And even now I get discouraged
I wonder if they take it all back will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I say ghost take control drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from everyone
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother will be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress, never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brains when I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy?
Cause I choose to puff a blunt, and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace there's a war in the streets
