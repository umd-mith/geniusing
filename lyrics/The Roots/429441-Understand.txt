People ask for God, 'till the day he comes
See God's face - turn around and run
God sees the face of a man
Shaking his head, says "he'll never understand"
Shakes his head then he says, "man’ll never understand”
Never understand, never understand
Never understand
Gravedigger, dig a hole that fit a black nigga
My body's stiff as a Madame Tussaud's wax figure
My transformation: a caterpillar from crack dealer
backpedaller was no less, than spectactular
Yeah I was trappin' money, flippin' like a spatula
Now put that sucker in a box like Dracula
I led the devil in a dance
An electric slide across the line I drew up in the sand
Love is like a harlequin's romance
Lost between sips of liquor, that empty bottle in my hands
It was a shot away, but I never got away
Dreamed a little dream of me, but that was an anomaly
[Verse 2: Greg Porn]
Holy, Sugar, Honey, Ice Tea
I guess that's a prayer for a player like me
In my church clothes baking buds on the bible
The sweet temptation of my grand daddy's rifle
Got me thinking 'bout doing a jihad with these guys
Who only True Religion look better than Levi's
Who baptize glasses with beers and blood stain
You preaching to the choir, that praise the drug game
Hallelujah
'Til the cops cuff me in the back of a cruiser
Or the firetruck wash my soul down the sewer
I count my blessings and blow it on a nun to resurrect my erection
I pray, I pray, All Dogs Go To Heaven
Or to a new hell with a Wi-Fi connection
So I can pay for my sins on PayPal
Or own a holy ghost, a greyhound
