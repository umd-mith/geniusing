[Intro: Greg Porn]
Lights, camera, chemical reaction
Attracted to a body of lies with fat asses
Thank the most high for the high of high fashion
My art of war is killer couture, denim assassin
[Verse 1: Greg Porn]
Am I, am I a douche bag or just another doo-rag?
Tryin' get ahead on some brand new-wave shit
For your entertainment money is the language
So every time I speak I’m tryin' to make another payment
I do ‘em dirty, sleep and get a dirt nap, that works
'Til my P.O. ask me where I work at
Think I would learned that sleeping in the bird trap
Living on the run like somebody tryin' burn fat
I don’t give a fuck, now maybe that’s abstinence
Or the arrogance of someone who ain’t got shit
That think money over bitches is a stock tip…
[Hook: Modesty Lycan]
I live in a trap where things go crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin’ he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer
[Verse 2: Black Thought]
I’m down to 95 dollars, that’s the extent of my riches
Out of 99 problems, 98 of ‘em is bitches
Out here hollerin' what’s ironic is
I’ve honestly been tryna do what’s right
But some jawn legs in the air tonight, like Phil Collins
I’m a sex-addicted introvert
Sucker for a pencil skirt
Looking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert
On my existential grind doing consequential dirt
Searchin’ for physical pleasure if I don’t go mental first
Molly poppin’
trolley hoppin’
Know somebody prolly watchin’
That ain’t stoppin’ me from coppin’ a feel
Karate choppin’ in this after-hours spot
Watching mommy body rockin’
First I feed her vodka shots
then she eat my Johnnie Cochran
Livin’ fast, drinkin’
capt'
One of them hoes even had
The audacity ask me how long this thing would last
I said, “You wanna pay for class?
Get on that stage and shake your ass.”
She keep a dick in a box
And "in an emergency, break the glass"
I make her laugh
She makes it clap
And then she gives me lap dances and I’m thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at
