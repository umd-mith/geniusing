If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry
You know that you got me
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building
On the same floor, and never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour, and peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly
taking classes abroad
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
things fall apart
When I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
Starting building with her constantly round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me…

Eve
Yo, I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip
And get on some old…
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player
And he think I'm pretty—
psych, I'm playin', boo
You know it's just with you I'm staying, boo
When you out there in the world I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies
They be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you saying, I can trust you?
But sometimes relationships get ill,
no doubt

I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry
You know that you got me
That snake could be that chick
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering, "She trying to play you for the fool, Black."
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See, I'm not at you every five minutes all on the phone
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be,
I ain't on some "Oh, I'm a celebrity!"
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to their squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…
