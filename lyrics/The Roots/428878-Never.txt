Street dreams, close your eyes
Say goodbye to my memory
Street dreams, this is the moment
The moment that feels like forever
This is the end to where I began
And it feels like forever
They say time flies
Down from the sky and says never
And all I know is all I know...
I was born faceless in an oasis
Folks disappear here and leave no traces
No family ties nigga no laces
Less than a full deck nigga no aces
Waitin' on Superman losing all patience
Gettin' wasted on an everyday basis
I'm stuck here can't take a vacation
So fuck it, this shit is damnation
This is reality mane
Ain't no surprise I've been bangin' without any mane
What is this gotta be brave
When into the night I'm going to go quietly mane
Life is a bitch and then you live
Until one day by death you're found
I tried to keep both of my feet on the ground
But I know my head is surrounded by clouds
Spirallin' down, destined to drown
Forever is just a collection of nows
Off on my own, nowhere is my home
Approaching infinity's fork in the road
When I was young something I often was told
It's not a bargain if it costs you your soul
Costs you your pride, caution aside
I'm gone with the wind and along for the ride
Wish I could rest and open my eyes
But time ain't finna fly down from the sky
A place where the lonely love
Not another soul's there, only us
I woke with a tear drop
All I know is what I know
I woke with a tear drop
All I know is what I know
It's all I know
All I know..
