[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running round town spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence
Even if I’m going to hell I’m gonna make an entrance
Yeah let em know I’m getting cheese like omeletes is
But I’m the toast of the town like Thomas is
We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score
Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying coldblooded hearts that never been for love
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn’t big enough
Now all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah that hindsight, 20/20
now niggas dead on the money
Trying to take something from me it’s a wrap like a mummy
Undun I am becoming and when he’s tired of running
Through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear cause they’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
I’m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to break a gun law
Thinking of how I’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
By any means necessary, don’t give a damn
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Get 'em gassed, leave em leaking fuel
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Now I’m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head
When I’m getting mine
