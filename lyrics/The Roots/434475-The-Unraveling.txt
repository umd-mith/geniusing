[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
I die here within (I die here within)
To be reborn again (To be reborn again)
And I'm somebody new today
Free of my sins today
Feels like they're washed away
A man with no future, a man with no future
[Verse 1: Black Thought]
What did the thief say unto the hanging man?
"Here come the hounds, lay your burdens down in advance"
Redemption in the slow grind of chance
My grandmother's hands, the Pomp and Circumstance
Free at last!, free at last! A different me at last
Scattered like an ash, or history that's past
Came from nowhere, disappear just as fast
A timetraveler headed to a night catches us
The final stop on the line for all passengers
[Outro: Raheem DeVaughn]
And I'm somebody new
Free of my sins today
Feels like they're washed away
A man with no future, a man with no future
