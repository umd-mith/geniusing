I’m so fucking dumb, I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There’s a diamond on my dick so there's a diamond on her tongue
I can’t feel you baby cause I'm romantically numb
Emotionally drained. I came here just so I can cum
There's nothing under God's sun that I haven’t done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn’t one
Girls is like buses: every 15 min. they run
Now they like potato chips: I just cannot have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don't like your friends in my business
Cause you ain't in the kitchen with me water-whipping
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking, boo, but we just don't believe you
Ok, I’m all about it, all for it
I’m all-star team Jordan, small forward
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I’m shooting if I draw for it
Life is moving fast: where the fuck do all these minutes go?
Mixtape dropped, then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred:
what the fuck you think I’m in it for?
Young Money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
"Fuck you" to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout-out to your girlfriend, nigga
lately she distracting me
Wondering if I’m the best? Well-I-am: no Black Eyed Peas
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
You can say whatever, girl, but we just don’t believe you
