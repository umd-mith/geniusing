Brick Squad about to walk in here
So cold I make bitch say BURR
Drinkin' on lean like a ice cold beer
Diamonds so big they hurt my ear
Sip codeine bitch, not Belvedere
Ballin' like a nigga on his first day out
You chain so little that it hurt my eye
Your watch ain't real, you a goddamn lie
Got some little bitty niggas, I'm a big ol' playa
Car collection, first placed it
Offered 10 years and he couldn't take it
Told on the whole damn operation
I'm a man bruh, so I'mma stand for
Everything I stand for
And I'm a hound dog, kinda fragile
Cause I drop down, better pipe down
EA, GA, AK to the peach state
And a bitch can't call me cheap skate
I'm worth 20 mil on Ebay
Gucci Mane ain't ballin'
Young bitch that what yo mouth say
Ain't no 1 on 1 nigga
He swing, I hit you
I ain't no front for fun nigga
He ridin' with you, he die with you
bite my tongue nigga
Everybody know I don't fuck with you
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party
Bet a million dollars at a month nigga
Quarter mil for a lunch nigga
Hundred dollars on a blunt nigga
Take care hand, don't talk nigga
200 dollars a blunt nigga
This ain't what you want nigga
Got rifles like I'm huntin' niggas
Hand choppers and pumps nigga
Got a young nigga, just slump niggas
But all I do is just point fingers
Had the niggas fightin' like Jerry Springer
Finger fuck a ho with my trigger finger
I know pimp niggas
I know gang bangers
Same plan, different angle
Got a wake for you and a funeral
And you Auntie numbers like candles
Big Guwap, I keep a banger
Tell the truth I don't like strangers
Trap game is a deadly game
but I tote the pistol  like Jesse James
Ain't no 1 on 1 nigga
He swing, I hit you
I ain't no front for fun nigga
He ridin' with you, he die with you
bite my tongue nigga
Everybody know I don't fuck with you
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party
