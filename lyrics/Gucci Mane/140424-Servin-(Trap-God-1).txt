I used to trap on the corner but that was decades ago
I was high as a cloud, and that was seconds ago
I had the game in the lock, a couple records ago
And I ain't never trust nobody, I was checkin the door
And if you spend a lil' bit mo', then your necklace a glow
He see me textin her phone, and now he chokin a ho
But he keep talkin bout a gangster he provokin a ho
I gave my dentist a 50 just for my trophies to show
I look like Pablo Escobar the way I'm holdin the dro
I feel like Boston George
, I got so many bales from the plug
I got a suite apartment wit an apartment under the rug
And every drank in my 'frigerator filled up with mud
I don't know bout nobody else, but I'm servin
And as long as these bags come in, I'm gone serve em
Niggas say they ain't getting money but I'm workin
I'm riding with so much dope that I'm nervous
If the police try to pull up on me, I'm gone swerve em
You ain't never seen so many guns on one person
Dump truck, two trucks came on one Thursday
You need to switch up the shit you doing just ain't workin
They got me feeling Nino couple mill in the safe
But when he snitched at the end it was a slap in the face
I need a bitch like Keyshia, shoot you middle of the day
And Pookie smoked, why the fuck G Money put some trust in a J
$30,000 worth narcotics, wrapped in some tape
I spend $130,000 dollar's just on my drapes
I got a coke model, super-model feedin' me grapes
And you can keep the money nigga, cause you paid me too late
And you ain't comin with me nigga, you tryna ride in the way
You just a spy, telling lies, tryna look at our place
You call me country to my face, I'll hit your ass with this 'K
Tomahawk, chop your head off, home of the Braves
