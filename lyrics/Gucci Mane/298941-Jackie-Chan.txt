Jackie Chan glasses, Rush Hour traffic
Buffie the Body
the buffer the fattest
Hitted the fool now he riding in the trunk
I might hit a bump
Don’t pass me the blunt because I’m in a slump
Smoking a blunt and
my trunk in the front
I’m cool with the chrome
One hit of the bong and I leave it alone
I know that it’s wrong but I jugg on the phone
Day to day business, cause dope with a tone
Gucci and Ziggy, we back in the business
My pockets my piggy,
I’m back on my throne
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, diamond wrists, kicking like Liu Kang
Bruce Wayne, Bentley coupe,
karate chop my brain
Alligator bally, Versace, Versace, Versace my ring
The j’s they love the cocaine
They sniffing the dope off my ring
You know that I’m a magician
The packs I get it and flip it
This lean is killing my kidneys
These birds are singing like Whitney
Call me Jackie, my diamonds kicking
I Came a long way from that midget
To pullin' up in Honda Civics
To dropping that top on my Bentley
I’m smoking on Jackie, my eyes is chinky
My money is long like a slinky
I fuck with a bitch look like Pinky
I’m Jackie Chan in my city
Where ever I go, I’m good, I can kick it
My eyes look like Jackie Chan ‘cause I smoke that mary jane
My eyes look so Asian, man, ‘cause I’m smoking that purple thing
Gucci Mane got stupid Jordans
My kick game on Jackie Chan
Me, Chris Tucker, ride through Tucker
Got pulled over, cause we’re two black brothers
Chris Tucker stop laughin' man
This shit here ain’t funny man
Rush Hour traffic, smoking that cabbage
Gucci got hands like Jackie Chan
Better yet, nigga Chuck Norris
Nigga told me he was back balling
Two weeks later he was back borrowin
Gucci Mane and Zay, we back man
