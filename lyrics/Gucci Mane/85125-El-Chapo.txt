All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him I'mma tell him bravo
I live a life so crazy make me start smoking newports
And you ain't coming in I'mma serve you in the front porch
My plug he comin' in im about a scoop him from the airport
Ballin' like a bitch you think my grandmother Griselda
These suckas they can't wait to double cross you like Diego
Im whackin' niggas, taxin' niggas similar to Pablo
Im big chained touchin' every penny like im Castro
Boss shit mob hits lucky Luciano
Bricksquad records like the damn Gambinos
The shit that I done did has only been done by Latinos
Plane just touch down thanks to Amado
Best coke in the world going through your nostrils
Plugs steady send the dope in by the boat load
Severing niggas heads off like El loco
A hundred bricks is nothin' if you jesus elizando
Spent a half a million last year on Forgiatos
And no I am not a catholic confessin' is a no no
So many bricks of brown and white you know we got a snow roll
Coke so clean every one brick is a combo
And it's a stack for a kilo if you get it in the jungle
