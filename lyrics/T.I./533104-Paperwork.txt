Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)
Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost, they gon' need something on you

[Verse 1: T.I.]
ATL, Westside, that's the only home I know
In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco
Took me up to Charles' Disco, daytime, set me down at the bar
Where I drank Shirley Temple
'Til he walked out with a bag and we got back in the car
"What you wanna be?" he asked "When you grow up big head?"
I just wanna be like you, ridin' round town gettin' bread
We shared a couple laughs, couple summer pass
Uncle Quint ain't nowhere to be found
Later we learn that someone ratted him out
For that reason 10 years he won't be around
[Hook: Pharrell]
Picture me, in '93
I'm the only man I see
Fresh up off the porch
Lookin' for a drop Porsche and a fake ID
Introduce me to the crack game
Rap game was the furthest from my mind
Had a notebook full of rhymes
And a pocket full of crack rock dimes
Time on my side, lil .45 in my jeans
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir
Welfare, food stamps
Section eight, me and Ma lived in the trap
I said fuck school, it holdin' me back
I wanna bankroll, chasin' after that
[Hook: Pharrell]
Look at me, at 17, livin' on my own, peddlin'
Quarter ki, now and then sellin' weed
Totin' tools, caughtt my first felony
That's one of many, that were to follow
Drinkin' Henney up out the bottle
Tote a choppa I think I'm bein' followed
Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow
Plenty have a story like mine
Know many of you had a little nine
Know many of you did a little dirt
Too many of us did a little time
When you get your cake up
Don't it seem lil' odd when the Feds on your ass passin' out?
[Hook: Pharrell]
If you think that you high, baby look above you
It's drones in the sky, there's nothing you could do
So left, two, three snap
Right two, three snap
Time on my side, lil .45 in my jeans
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir
[Hook: Pharrell]
