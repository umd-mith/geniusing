Hey stop goddamn fussin' all the time man, listen
[Hook: Victoria Monet + (T.I.)]
I love you and I know you love me too, ohh
(I love you shawty, I know you love me)
I love you and I ain't ashamed to beg you to stay
(Fo'real, listen, ay, hey
You so high, I get what I need from you
Shawty I get on my knees for you
And I get what I need from you
I swear, I get on my knees for you)
So that we can be together forever
Aye, I wonder would it matter much
If I never fucked and I just fell in love
Or maybe if I never fell in love and I just fucked
I swear, man, shit was simpler when I was sellin' drugs
You ain't know me then though, ain't that what ya think
You was in the bed, I was trafficking the thing
Man after everything we will never be the same
I remember you got a tattoo, put my name on it
Put you in a wedding dress with a train on it
I went and spent a whole mil just to go chill
In Miami, and I be damned if she don't know my love real
How dare you compare me to dude, girl chill
My piece so close up on it, you don't see what it is
Shawty, I die, kill for you if you keep it real
Go to jail, even if I gotta kneel I will
I can't see you with no me
But, you left me and I'm just me
So, I'm gon' be what they gon' be
Girl, together or apart
But you be forever in my heart, I swear
And even if we end up here, I know it hard
I never love that way again, I swear to God
I be breaking down, you be playing hard
