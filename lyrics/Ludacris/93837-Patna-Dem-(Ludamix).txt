I was on the ave' cuttin slabs with my patna' dem
Then I left the block and hit the lab with my patna' dem
Flipped a couple bad little bitches with my patna' dem
Beat a fuck nigga, get some stitches for my patna' dem
Ciroc, this my fucka' I'm a sip it with my patna' dem
Roll a couple of swishers, hit the blunt with my patna' dem
Fresh up on the scene looking clean with my patna' dem
Got a bag of kush and some beans from my patna' dem
Nigga wanna problem, scrap them squabble with it patna' dem
Boulevard (My patna' dem)
Herndon Holmes (My patna' dem)
Summer Hill (My patna' dem)

D-D-DTP (My patna' dem)
College park my patna' dem
Benjamins, I got lots of them
Come and try to take my Benjamins and see big Glocks and me cocking them
Platinum hits, I'm dropping them
Louie kicks, I'm rocking them
Fifteens in the trunk, I'm knocking them
Why the 5 percent tint on this Bentley window always blocking them?
Cause Lil' Scrappy my patna' dem
Tity Boi, I'm on the block with him
Dolla Boy he be robbing them and Lil' Fate I ride in the drop with him
I-Dub, we be swapping them
Get a couple of bills and popping them
Ching-a-ling was DTP but we had to end up dropping him
Now B.X.C., my patna' dem
Willy and P what's popping Slim?
DTP still going strong and all these hoes be jocking them
Doing them and bopping them
Screwing them, chop-chopping them
Notorious like B.I.G. and he even got a little bit of Pac in him
Now new artists, we shopping them
Air ones, we stocking them
Hit the dealership, get a brand new whip and then we hop in them
Bad boy like Block and them
It's going down like Joc and them
Chaka Zulu and Jeff Dixon, I'm going all the way to the top with them
Business deals, we locking them
Forbes list, we topping them
And Conjure cognac is coming soon, no diss to Ciroc and them
Ohhhhh
