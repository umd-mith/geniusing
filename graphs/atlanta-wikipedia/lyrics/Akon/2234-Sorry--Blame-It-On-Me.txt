So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I understand there are some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away
I understand there are some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryin' to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
Just a little young girl tryin' to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out, disgracing my name
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
