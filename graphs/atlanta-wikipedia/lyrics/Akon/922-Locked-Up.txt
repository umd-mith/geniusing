I'm steady tryin' to find the motive
Why I do what I do?
Freedom ain't getting no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
Cops patrolin' and now they done stop me
And I get locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
They won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
Heading uptown to re-up
Back with a couple keys
Corner block's on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Making so much money
Product's moving fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
They won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
‘Cause visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cellmates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out
And move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
They won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
Maybe a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Maybe a visit, baby (they won't let me out)
‘Cause I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Wheres my lawyer? (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no
Get me outta here (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
Baby I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no
Where's my niggas? On the lock-down
Damn, I'm locked up, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Ohhh... they won't let me out
Can you please accept my phone calls?
‘Cause I'm locked up, locked up, locked up
