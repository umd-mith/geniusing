Wonderful world
I can feel it in my veins
What a wonderful world
It can be
[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
At the drop of a dime, I climb the top of the line
To conquer minds, I treat pressure like confidence time
Back against the pine down in an impossible grind
Got diamond cut thoughts and million dollar ideas
And nightmares I've seen make the average nigga cry tears
If you afraid to die then how you know what living life is?
I'm on edge hanging to faith and making my sight clear
Yeah, living like death was just never invented
Rolling down memory lane tinted can't tell what was in it
Odd wolf till I decide to give this gig up
Forgive us for future shit cause we don't give ten fucks
Rap game's stressful, fold a nigga like a sit-up
I'm optimistic, always feel my cup is about to fill up
[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Who caused more pain, the slave or the master?
And who got more game, the pimp or the whore?
On her knees giving thanks for the shit she afford
But I don't do church cause the seats ain't heated
And the roof don't drop so my soul feel cheated
Lord knows, wood-grain four doors
Do she love me for my money? Do she love me for my soul?
But as long as you love me then pack your bags we gotta go
Niggas hatin' on the low, hate to see a nigga rise
the pain that money bring is never outweighed by the feeling of gettin' paid
Switchblades when they switch up, stab you in the back
Over sun rooftops with the diamond on the 'Lac
