I had a dream about you the other day
Do you want to hear about it?
Okay..
[Verse 1]
When the sky was green with periwinkle trees
Screaming on the sun 6000 degrees
I remember the way it felt
We carried guns and we fought to the death
How dare you carry on...
With your stupid life like we don't belong
In our own brigade
Camo as our grenades
Sitting in the shade drinking pink lemonade
Hard wood floors, cardboard box
All night long
Hip hop rocks!
MJ in the kitchen slide around in your socks
I don't know when the whole thing... stopped
[Interlude]
(Umm... I feel like I- just eat way too much sugar before I go to sleep
Something... I don't know
Should I keep going?
Anyway)
Pardon me this is New York City
All my girlfriends say I'm way too pretty
To be crying over some wack ass nigga
They all have boyfriends though so go figure
And so that leaves me at this place
That every time I look at your fucking face
I wonder if you ever even miss me at all
I say no, but it's your call
I find myself just zoning out
Feeling all alone and without a doubt
I'm staring at the sun, I hope my eyes fall out
(I know, it's kinda harsh but)
I bet it'd feel about the same, as it does every time I hear your name
And that stupid ass sound that it makes
I don't know even know whose life... to take...
[Interlude 2]
(Me or you.... you or me...
I don't know, just nightmares, driving me crazy
Can't even deal anymore)
I want you still [x3]
I hate you but
I want you still
I want you still [x2]
I want you
I hate you but
I want you
