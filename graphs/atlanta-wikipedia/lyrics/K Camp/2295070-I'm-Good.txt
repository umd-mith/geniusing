When it rains I think of you
When all them nights I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back
But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good
I told a thousand lies to prevent the cries
Now it's good bye cause I realized I'm good
Now I done moved on, feeling gone
I'm good
She say that I'm acting different
She say I'm not the same nigga
Last time I checked when I looked in the mirror
Bitch I was the same nigga
But I do apologize for all them times I made you cry
Even though I tried to make that bullshit work
Guess we couldn't see eye to eye
And I'm not the guy that you fantasize
You couldn't hold on that I'm on the rise
Now I got a new bitch, don't act surprised
I'm just a young nigga tryna multiply
My bankroll, and I know I'm not perfect at all
Just want to know are you there when I fall?
If ain't real I don't want it at all
Will you be there when I call?
When it rains I think of you
When all them nights I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back
But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good
Time go by and I see you
That yo ass got a brand new nigga
I just hope that you happy
I just hope that you happy
And I ain't gon' lie, yah it be some nights
That I really do miss you
But I just hope that you happy
I just hope that you happy
But he can't fuck you like I do
Can't fuck you like I do
Lick you up, now turn your ass around
And I hit it from the back like boom
I done packed my bags and my suitcase full
Baby ain't no room
So I ain't really worried about you
I ain't really worried about you
But I know
When it rains I think of you
When all them nights I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back
But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good
I told a thousand lies to prevent the cries
Now it's good bye cause I realized I'm good
Now I done moved on, feeling gone
I'm good
