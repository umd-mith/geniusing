Aye get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, aye get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, aye get fucked up
We ain't doing much tryna have a good time
Got 4 bad bitches man the pleasures all mine
Girls kissin' girls best believe they all fine
Gir-girls kissin' girls best believe they all fine
Let go, let go, let go, let go
What you doin'?
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, aye get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, aye get fucked up
Verse 1]
4 bad bitches, man the pleasure all mine
We ain't doin' nothing, tryin' to have a good time
Roll around the city, Porsche seats on recline
4 bad bitches fuckin' at the same time
Bitch named Keisha got an ass like a bubble
Feed her M&M's, watch it turn to some trouble
Two hands on the ball, shorty just doubled
Once I get mine I ain't trying to cuddle
All in the party hippy trippy off the henny
Jar full of weed, baby girl I got plenty
Break fast for the chick like I work at Denny's
Shawty where the shots I need many, many, many
Molly in the system, drinkin' out the bottle
Shorty goin' in, going hard full throttle
Instagram likes got her feeling like a model
If you looking' for the drugs, don't worry I got em

Aye get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, aye get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, aye get fucked up
We ain't doing much tryna have a good time
Got 4 bad bitches man the pleasures all mine
Girls kissin' girls best believe they all fine
Gir-girls kissin' girls best believe they all fine
Let go, let go, let go, let go
What you doin'?
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, aye get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, aye get fucked up
Bridge]
Shot number 4 got her still talking sober
Molly got her ass wide awake no Folgers
Aye what it is Diego bring the Doja
One more shot, I'm in that hole like a gopher
Smoke, smoke, smoke
Drink, drink, drink
Bitch I'm Getting money give a damn what you think
One more shot, hella bent, might faint
Super lit hit it ho
Going hard in the paint
Fruit rolling up he ain't ran out of yet
Boutta take off, my migos offset
Rolled up the blunt, got a dutch full of Shrek
Said that she want more, guess she ain't done yet
Green Green Green
Mean Mean Mean
Bad bitch kissin'
I ain't tryin' to intervene
If you gone do it baby do it for the team
And it's on blowing strong
Money long, Limousine
