Look, you ever been sick and tired of being tired?
Living in a world where everybody want to count you out
But as soon as you make it, as soon as you make it
Everybody walking with they hand out
I ain’t here to make friends, I’m here to make music
And prove to these niggas that I do it
Prove to these niggas that I do it
Praying every night that a nigga don’t lose it
Y’all niggas do too much talking
I just let my work do the speaking
Just say the word, I’ll kill the whole summer
Motherfucker just give me a reason
I feel like I’m the realest nigga breathing
They been ask why your bitch chose
If you dig down deep might find a soft spot
Until then we don’t love these hoes
Last year I counted money with my bros
I swear to god ain’t no better feeling
Met a bad bitch in Minnesota last year
Say she 22, Andrew Wiggins
KWayy
