Lay her flat just like some sandals
Flip her like a channel
Then pass her off straight to Lambo
All my niggas slum,all my niggas slum
Unwrap her like a gift I'm like rampapapam

So girl ,don’t you dare play dumb
Yell out hundred rounds

That bitch thick like peanut butter
She just need my jelly
Tell me when you’re ready

It's some slums in the house
Slum lords, slum lords, slum lords
Slum lords, slum lords, slum lords

Rule number two: No tolerance
Rule number three: Don’t you dare claim me
