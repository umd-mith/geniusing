[Hook]
I let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
So what you doin' later?
Let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
And that's 1hunnid, baby, just keep it a hunnid, baby
Just keep it a hunnid, baby
I'm just tryna figure out just why that nigga hate me
I got money and I throw it with no hesitation
Sneaky bitches, they be schemin' and investigatin'
But I'ma leave 'em waitin', put you in that drop top
Pull up in that mothafucka, make your heart stop
Lame bitches on the side tryna cock block
I pulled off her panties, next it was the crop top
Takin' all these nigga's bitches, you can say I'm Drakein'
I'm that nigga, you that bitch and ain't no damn mistakin'
So tell me why we waitin'
I let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle,
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
Let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
And that's 1hunnid, baby, just keep it a hunnid, baby
Just keep it a hunnid, baby
Okay now I'm back again
Rubber bands on rubber bands, you can tell a friend
Slumber party, top floor, bring 'em all in
Missed call, that's your old lady callin'
Heard my name around the city, girl you know it's me
You say you bored, let's get some money, no Monopoly
Ain't no flexin' on my pay, I get that broccoli
Lay it down, I'ma eat it like my last meal
Blew a hundred, still got hundreds in the stash still
I let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
Let you count my money, baby
You 1hunnid so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty you my kind of lady
And that's 1hunnid, baby, just keep it a hunnid, baby
Just keep it a hunnid, baby
