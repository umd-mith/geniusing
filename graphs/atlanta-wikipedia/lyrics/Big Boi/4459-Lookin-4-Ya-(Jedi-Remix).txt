Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you
Where are you now
I've been looking for you
Come through, get you
Riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you
I've been looking for you
Let me give you one to grow on
Me and you have been digging each other now for so long
Like an archaeologist looking for our bones
We used to do it to the slow songs
Then our hormones would mix up from the sweat
Cause I feel it drip drop from my pecs to your chest
I send a text from the jet
Just to get you slippery
Memories of you soaking wet
That's the only time I might slip
Then I slide between them thighs
She keeps it tight-lipped
Like a vice grip, it's so private
Mum's the word unless I'm knee deep inside it
Three's company not crowded
I get cake, eat it too and apple pie
Slices with the ice cream, icing, à la mode
She inspires and excites me now you know
(On some cool shit)
Well here's a revolutionary idea
Why don't we both stay home
And if the doorbell goes ding-dong
We can act like we not here
Put them house coats on and take them right back off
As a result, like we work at Ikea
Test every piece of furniture to see if it is stable
You wanna take it out on me then do it on the table
Blow to the head is fatal
Wait til, you get a load of me
I ain't joking, Dark Knight, Batman
And I'm poking that pussy Cat Woman
Poke-it-man, baby gon' push it back on me
Hoping that maybe you'll wake up in the morning
And forget about it all
I hate to see you sad so if anybody call
Tell em that you'll let em know
When we fall back to earth,
I've been looking for you
Come on in
I've been looking for you baby
Where you been
(Where you been)
No more wasting time
Let's gone and get it in, get it in
And I won't stop, don't stop
Til I make that leg drop
Yeah, they wanna follow in my footsteps
But I'mma go something like the Boogie Man
Never forget that
You musta fell down and bumped your cranium
Been moving crowds, rock halls and stadiums
Maybe I'm one of the best you'll ever meet
The Greatest Show On Earth, B.I.G
And I'mma make you remember me
I stay colder than December, B
Mr. Freeze, only want to see her on her knees
Through pregnancy, are at a all time high
Keep it sci-fi, wi-fi
Always connected to muchacha, watch out bwoy
The time flies by as the Cadillac glides
It's the Return of the Jedi
Niggas know better
Antwan and Andre together
Dungeon Family for the Dub-i-ya
I-N, like Khaled all we do is win, win
I-I-I be on it, in and out it, in and out it
In and out it, in and out it, went about it
Like I owned it,
Said my name repeatedly, repeated me
Like Tony Toni Toné
Tony, Tony
I know, I know, I know
I said two too many Tony's
I’m not usually a morning person
But certain skirts can makes me
Pull back the curtain and let the sun burst in
She searching for her Ken, Barbie
Her skin makes my Berlin Wall fall down
A one night stand, number on nightstand
She ain’t gon’ never leave me hanging like an old white man
But she don’t understand that I’m a fan of Steely Dan
And she like everything that’s on the radio and I demand she change it
