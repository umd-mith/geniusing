[Verse 1: Drake]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm an optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, it's strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out with me, no paparazzi
I'm trying give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

[Hook: Quavo]

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

[Verse 4: Tyga]
Versace, Versace, I brought that shit back, all these niggas they copy
Medusa head on me I'm at the hotel, Versace Palazzo
I rented the yacht for a week, but I bought the convertible Lambo
Six mill for the mansion
I see haters coming I need some more ammo
These niggas gay that's Elmo
So much green I turned camo
Some hoover niggas on flannels
Light light you up no candle
Grip on that handle Yosemite Sam ya, that bitch bang like a banjo
Told my arms dealer no need for a box, I don't read the instructions, I throw out the manual (WOO!)
Versace, Versace, my brother king Trell he in a Ferrari
I don't look the same, my camera the same, I made too much money (WOO!)
Paul Pierce is my neighbor, I told him he should of went to the Clippers
I got some crazy ideas for Versace, get them and tell'em my number
Versace, auggh Picasso, Basquiat I'm cocky
23, 15 mill I'm just getting started
Pop water my water
I walk around on my wallet
I don't fuck with Saddam but, that's gold all in my toilet
Statues of Horus, and Anubis is polished
I don't got to, rap about, coke for you to enjoy it
I'm bout' to join the money team, just holla' to Floyd about it
Versace, Versace, I'm taking my money to the Cayman islands (WOO!) Versace Auggh!!
[Verse 5: Quavo]
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "Versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble

[Verse 6: Takeoff]
You can do Truey, I do it Versace
You copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Cookin' this dope like I work at Hibachi
Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
Go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
These niggas they wishin' they knew you
They coppin' the Truey, remixing the Louis
My blunts is fat as Rasputia
In a striped shirt like I’m Tony the Tiger
I’m beating the pot, call me Michael
Lot of you niggas that copy
Look at my closet Versace, Versace

[Verse 7: Offset]
King of Versace, Medusa my wifey
My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi
I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy
You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body
Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'
My diamonds is pissing, my swag is exquisite
Young Offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin, Versace I’m gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I’m living
I’m draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that’s Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I’m the don, but no Rocco
This the life that I chose
Bought out the store, can’t go back no more
Versace my clothes while I’m selling them bows
Versace take over it took out my soul
