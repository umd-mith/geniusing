Smoke one one time (smoke one)
Drink one one time (drink, drink)
Lemme fuck some one time
Tear the club up one time
Smoke some one time (smoke)
Drink some one time (drank)
Lemme fuck some one time
Turn the club up one time
Only take one time
Only take one time for me to put my eyes on you, I'm looking at you
Only take one time for me to just get high with you (gas, gas!)
Only take one time for me to just pull up (skrr)
Only take one time for my nigga to pull up with the choppas
And a hundred round drum
Cut 'em off one time and they gone (Nawfside)
What type of shit that you on? (type of shit that you on)
What type of drug that you on?
YRN the label we put em on
Championship, you know that we winning one this year
I don't have to empty the clip, she want Tommy outta here
Took your ho for the first time (one time)
And I only hit her one time
I walk in the jewelry store for the first time
I'm walking out looking like Busta Rhymes
I told my niggas we gonna see dollar signs
I told em one time
We overseas for the first time, but it sure ain't the last time
Now the choppa sounding like a drum line
Call up the plug one time (plug!)
He pulling up with a hundred lines
One rum and one cosign (Cosign)
Have you in the drop top, no mind (skr skrr)
Lemme smash one time, lemme pass one time
Lil mama staring at me, hit the gas one time
One time, one time, one time
I got more chains on than Busta Rhymes
Niggas cloning me but I am one of a kind
Only take one time for a nigga to snitch (snitch)
Only take one time caught with a brick
Bumping yo lip you get shot in yo shit
All of this work I need me a forklift
Hit a nigga with a choppa only one time
And I got the pocket rocket and it's on me all the time
My diamonds hit one time and it make you blind
Technical foul fuck nigga crossed the line
I got two hundred buried in the ground
One gun with bout 200 round
They looking for you in the lost and found
Thinking bout running up
I'mma chop you with the choppa then I hit the runner up
My mansion's got expensive furniture
My stingray Corvette, it come with the turbulence
Hit the gas one time, it's over with
I'm in Vegas in casinos and I'm betting my poker chips
Just like a spider, I web up the game
People they think it's Peter Parker here
One song Versace and it got us the fame
Niggas biting but ain't gon say your name
Migo my family, only one gang
I came from the Northside and invaded the A
Start fucking up the city now we got our own lane
Now we blowing up like we on a mine
Givenchy khakis, Versace down my spine
Speeding in traffic I'm doing 200
That nigga say fuck the stop sign
Taking your bitch and I fuck her one time
But that bitch she be calling me more than one time
I drop a 8 one time, y'all drinking one line
You ain't never seen a hundred thousand dollar one time
