I gotta get out of here, this city’s gonna kill me
Could be anywhere
Anywhere but here
I wonder how long before this shit gone take me under
[Verse 1]
Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman movin through Gotham
Dodging pot holes
as I gently move through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as I'm passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him (Queens)
Forty one times, he committed no crime
But I guess life ain't Times Square
But in the city that’s gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayor’s a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it
And Brooklyn, keep on taking it
Cause life just ain't that fair
Tryin' to flip them a pack, stack up a couple racks
And make it the hell outta here… (New York)
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me, out to me
I can hear them calling out
I maneuver through the ATL
black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though it’s black top from the mayor to the cops
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house, no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward, these young black boys
Seem to self-sabotage they selves
Or maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston, well it kills itself... (Atlanta)
