[Pulp Fiction sample]
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish
And the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger
Those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers
And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee."
Heroin flow, y'all niggas heat your spoons up
Tatum O'Neal
