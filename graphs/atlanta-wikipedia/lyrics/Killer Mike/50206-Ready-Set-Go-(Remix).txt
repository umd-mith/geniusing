Get low, get low or get right right
Holla killer kill for the villa Big Mike Big Mike
Get low get low or get right right

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I know these streets bout tired of this weak shit
Your style been ran through like a freak bitch
The pussy club got you angered with your frequent
Ed Hardy ass nigga and ya sequins
Might as well shop at Victoria's Secret
Have 'em gift wrap you some "I love Pink" shit
Rent due and y'all niggas delinquent
You better find another nigga to link with
Cause the nigga you link with is a lie fool
I used to bully that monkey nigga in high school
Sit at the lunch table, steal and eat his damn food
The pretty girls, they say, Michael a damn fool
I get my work on, and get my flirt on
I say fuck 'em he a pussy put a skirt on 'em
I say fuck 'em he a pussy put a skirt on 'em

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
I'm the product, of the age of narcotta
Which means I'm dope like the pills you swallow
Down by law I lead don't follow
Grind time, grand hustle live for the gualla
I remain in the game to break lames off
Some of them sensitive and some too soft
The hood been forced to fuck with y’all by default
But now the truth here the bullshit cuts off
This is real homie, no fake, no filler
One hundred percent grade A killer
Something like the bitch that I keep in Villa Rica
But I’ma be quiet ‘cause they might Mike Vick ya
Might catch Mike with a light Mike Vicka
Some purple kush that'll get me high like a missile
Smoking one deep homie cause I don’t fuck with you
Sincerely from the hustle and grind time official
Lets go lets go
Grand hustle
[Hook T.I.]
