Lord
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin up
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young
Go back to from whence you came
My family tree my family name
For some strange reason it had to be
Aerle Taree
Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth
