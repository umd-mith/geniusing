From the CO to across the seas
I'm guaranteed to make everybody bounce wit me
14
I done started up a whole epidemic
Look, y'all know what I'm talkin' about
Ever since I hooked up with the homey down south
TV shows, magazine covers
Girls in groups say we go wit each other
Sold out shows, pocket full of cake
What you know about sellin' tres mil out the gate?
Neck full of bling bling like the Neptunes' sound
When I step up in the spot this is all I hear
Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take you home

I said Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take you home
Represent that - (So So Def)
I'mma forever be up under the scope
I ain't tryna go out like Todd Bridges of "Different Strokes"
was born to rock, born to rhyme
What you lookin' at is something that's before they time
Like the number 23 in the red and black
Mr. 106 and Park is back, Holla
I do it like no other
And attract more family than 'Ringling Brothers'
I got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like, hash browns
See, I'm the best just ask around
Yo, I'm here now and ain't nobody takin' mine
It's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can
You better off gettin a shirt
Makin a sign that reads, "SHAD MOSS, I'm your #1 fan"
