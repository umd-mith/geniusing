They can all say what they want
Cause you make it do what it do (do what it do, do what it do, do what it do)
But you just keep living your life
And they can keep wasting time hating on you (hating on you, hating on you)
They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
And they get mad when you win
Cause that’s when they lose (that’s when they lose, that’s when they lose)
And you got better shit to do with your time
They hating on ya because they know you bad
Must be doing something right if you got these bitches mad
Now she 19 stripping just to pay the bills
A single parent mom know it gotta be hard
For some baby daddy never seen the kid
She searching for love & she say that it’s tough
And between all that she still in school
Using college as a back up plan
And like pac said, keep ya head up
I know it’s hard at times, you get fed up
But don’t let up, gotta stay strong
But whatever you just don’t give up
Don’t worry bout him, just do you
Stay focused, get on your grind
Just know that you can call on me
Whenever them niggas get out of line
And see a good friend is so hard to find
Somebody who down to ride
The best is yet to come for you
Don’t let nobody steal your pride
Ohh baby
They can all say what they want
Cause you make it do what it do (do what it do, do what it do, do what it do)
But you just keep living your life
And they can keep wasting time hating on you (hating on you, hating on you)
They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
And they get mad when you ain’t
Cause that’s when they lose (that’s when they lose, that’s when they lose)
And you got better shit to do with your time
You done came up, that’s why everybody done changed up
You would think you worked at gold’s gym
The way you done stepped your weight up
Got a new man and got a new life
Bout to become a new wife
Looking like a new woman
Feels like you been blessed twice
Done stopped dancing and graduated
All it took was a little patience
Never mind how you got here
Just know that you finally made it
I’m just living in it but its your world
You deserve it, you worked hard, you balling’ now
Got a new car, no car note, cause it’s paid off (damn)
And i’m proud of ya, (proud of ya) you came a long way
And if you need some inspiration
Just let this song play
Because a good friend is so hard to find
Somebody who down to ride
The best is yet to come for you
Don’t let nobody steal your pride
Ohh baby
They can all say what they want
Cause you make it do what it do (do what it do, do what it do, do what it do)
But you just keep living your life
And they can keep wasting time hating on you (hating on you, hating on you)
They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
And they get mad when you ain’t
Cause that’s when they lose (that’s when they lose, that’s when they lose)
And you got better shit to do with your time
Ay fuck these bitches, let ‘em hate
That’s why they hating girl, you winning
So don’t pay them no attention
Fuck them bitches let ‘em hate
Jealous of you cause they can’t be in your position
Fuck these bitches, let ‘em hate
That’s why they hating girl, you winning
So don’t pay them no attention
Fuck them bitches let ‘em hate
Jealous of you cause they can’t be in your position
Ohh baby
They can all say what they want
Cause you make it do what it do (do what it do, do what it do, do what it do)
But you just keep living your life
And they can keep wasting time hating on you (hating on you, hating on you)
They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
And they get mad when you ain’t
Cause that’s when they lose (that’s when they lose, that’s when they lose)
And you got better shit to do with your time
