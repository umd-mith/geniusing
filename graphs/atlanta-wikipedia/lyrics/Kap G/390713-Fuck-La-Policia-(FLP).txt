You see the cops pulled me over
The cops pulled me over, aye
Now I'm just riding with my migos
Riding with my migos, aye
I'm screaming fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, aye
I be like fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, aye
Now I don't got a Bentley, just in my hyundai car
And I know what you thinking, think I got no green card
Think I push work now he bringing out the canine
They trying to lock us up, always riding on our block
a ?
Cause I'm Mexican yeah on some young migo shit
Trying to search in my whip trying to find some fucking bricks
And my uncle he illegal, my uncle he illegal, aye
And I can't fuck with la migra, can't fuck with la migra, aye
So the cops pulled me over say, "the windows too tinted"
Basically saying that my migos ain't from here
I don't give them two minutes, I get my ticket and leave
And my bro tatted up they think he MS13
No he bang Latin Kingz
they trying to go lock him in
And all this happened last night, I don't your advice
I don't got my pistol on me quit flashing your flashlight
Where your license registration? My license registration, aye
Trying to sent me to the fucking immigration, the fucking immigration, aye
