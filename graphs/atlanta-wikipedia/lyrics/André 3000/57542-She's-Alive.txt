A boy
To raise
At a
Young age
No help
From him
But she's alive
To be
Made strong
But all
Alone
Must be
A pain
But she's alive
The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was going down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now
I was scufflin' going to school
I was scufflin' working at night
And you know what
I truly believe
And that's why I tell a lot of parents
Single parents, don't tell me what God can't do
I made sure you had
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child
You move on
And that's what I did
I moved on
He always wanted to be a father
But he never took care of you
He ain't have no money
He ain't have nothin'
How can you care about somebody
And you never give the welfare of them
And I knew I had to go that road by myself
