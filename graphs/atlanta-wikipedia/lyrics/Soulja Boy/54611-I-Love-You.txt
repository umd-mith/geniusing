Stop at the light, I’mma jump out my Barbie dream car
I’mma jump on him ima ride him like a theme park
Family guy, let’s have a little Stewie
Bust a U-ie
I forgot my Huey, Dewey, Louie
Red and Green lamb we call it watermelon
I call him SB he call me Nicki tell ‘em
I’m badder than a felon
He’s generous like Ellen
Ain’t talking hair products
When I say that we gellin
I’m the Barbie and he's the Ken
Get my prenup, then get my pen
Get my flower girls, and get my bridesmaid
Don’t need a gift lil mama, cause this brides paid!
