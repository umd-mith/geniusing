I walked in the muhfuckin club playing GameBoy Color
I'm retro, nigga, everything, nigga
I made swag
I invented juice (juice juice juice!)
I invented SOD
I look so good, I look so pretty (Dre!)
I look so good, I look so pretty (Dre)
I look so good, I ain't looked this good since I was 18
Excuse me if I say a couple things that I don't mean
Like I look better than your girlfriend
And we can all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these old niggas?
Mad cause I make it look so easy..
I look so muthafuckin good, I look so muthafuckin great
I smoke so muthafuckin good,
I drink that muthafuckin lean
Walk in side the club, make them hoes touch their toes
I look so good, nigga, fuck Sandra Rose!
Fuck all them blogs! Bitch I'm on my job
You keep talking down I bet you get your ass robbed
Pretty Boy Swag, man, them hoes on my cock
Looked at my dick, damn that shit got hard!
I look so pretty,
bitch, I'm killing all these beats
Fuck Sandra Rose nigga! I don't give a fuck
