Let me tell you about the life
And how live when you a star
Every single place you go
The people run up to your car
Everybody wants to talk
Everybody wants to jive
Everybody wants a hand shake
Or want a high five
Yahhh yahhh trick and your friend yahhh yahhh too

All in my face

Walkin' up
"Soulja boy can I have your autograph"
Snitch yahhh trick
Leave me alone
Let me get some peace
I'm sittin' at the house
Shawty and I can't sleep
Leave me alone folks
Before I have to knock your lights out
"Hey Soulja Boy

Snitch yahhh trick snitch yahhh trick
Yahhh Ya yahhh ya yahhh yahhh
