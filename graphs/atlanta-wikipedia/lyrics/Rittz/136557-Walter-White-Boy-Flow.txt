They say that Rittz ain’t shit, Rittz ain’t rich
But you never heard nobody say that Rittz can't spit
If you’re looking for some bullshit, this ain’t it
I just did a line of speed, 'bout to feel the drain drip
Nose on fire, throat on fire
Got my coat on, glowing, homie, no bow-tie
Drinking Crown for some more,
Rappers copy me sloppily, oh so twat
No, adios guys - maybe I should help 'em out
I could try and ghostwrite for 'em, if it goes right
Maybe Bootleg Kev'll play it on the show
afternoon
Like on that Big Sean song, Chief on strong
Weed got me staring at a big-boned blonde
I can see above her cheeks she had a big thong on
Didn't mack, cause I could tell she need a King Kong schlong
Damn, I forgot to put it in her ass
Just to make her feel me enter it, consider it, and maybe later
I'll find an Asian chick cause her hands'll make it bigger
I'm just tripping, that's the shit I say when I be drinking liquor
Doing meth is a gift, I receive and I'm a giver
That line's dedicated to my homie Scender
My pissed-off manager can't control his temper
Far from a newcomer
got the cue
Done an aged bitch
I'mma keep it 200
What? You hated how I look, but I finally grew on ya
Fuck you, homicide, a lot of people do, burn a soup runner
Cause I'm feeling like my stomach getting lit
Empire Business
