(Suge White Shot me)
Dear Lord, thank you for letting me be here to see another day again
I'm grateful to be alive, God bless the souls that came and went, I'm so lucky...
To have a good family that loves me
Please let my girl, know how much I love her
Sorry that we're both so unhealthy
I feel so guilty...
Every time I pray I feel like I ask you to help me
I don't pray with the hopes to get wealthy
I just want success, I know it sounds selfish
I've always been a screw up...
I finally got the chance to fix it
I signed a record deal after all these years
I wish I was more optimistic
I'm really just scared...
What if they don't like what they hear?
What if I don't make a career out of music?
What am I supposed to do then?
I'm always getting judged...
I hate to see my face in the mirror
I done wrote about everything, so many times
I don't have inspiration to spare
I'm barely even here
I've been out on the road
And I feel like I've been gone all year
Even when I'm home there's so much pressure to be Rittz
It's hard to feel like I'm all there
So many wish, they could rap for a living
So complaining about it, it's unfair
Some days I feel like I've been living in a dream
Other times feeling like a nightmare
And I need some ideas
Cause I got a bunch of songs to write
And I'm feeling like my future all depends on this
Gotta rid myself of mental blocks and censorships
Gotta get some confidence back in my penmanship
I don't wanna disappoint the fans who listening
Cause they expecting something incredible in the end
Without them, I'm nothing as I begin to get my stride back
I remember when I was a kid
And my dad, he would teach me how to play the guitar
Me and my brother would pretend that we was in a band
Musicians in my family was dreaming to be stars
So I'mma quit tripping and get behind this mic and rhyme
