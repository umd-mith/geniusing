I wish that I could write
I wish I didn't drink
Have to do drugs just to concentrate and think
I wish that I could sleep, I never got a wink
Gotta work a double when I finish I'mma stink
And my feet keep throbbin
I wish that I could rest
Wish I woulda finished school I never shoulda quit
Wish I didn't blame it on my parents
Disappearance of my father traumatizin' wish he never woulda left
That excuse is getting old
So is doing drugs
Reefer got me paranoid, so is doing bumps
But I still got a dollar bill to my nose snorting clear off a mirror
Man I wish I had a gun
But once again I bluff cause I really wanna live
I just wanna hug and a kid from my girl but she left
And my bed feels empty when I'm in it
Ain’t a minute passin by that I dont wonder where she is
More than a couple of my friends done drifted
Far from each other homie I just wish that
We could travel back in time and just re-live it;
For a minute
When did we become so distant
Its been sunny outside and I'm high and wishin it'd rain
When I'm visitn memory lane and I'm wishin this Whiskey will whisk me away in the daylight
Miss you when I'm gone, Gotta hit the road
I be gettin throwed every city is a blur
I kill it on the stage, takin pictures with these girls afterwards
But I really just be wishin they was her
Wish I didn't read the, negative comments that everybody wanna leave
Underneath the songs that I put up on the internet
I'm finna let it bother me,
a part of me just wishes they would leave me alone
My journey wasn't easy to get here, I wish that they could see how far I came
G's for some T-shirts and CD's
I barley got a dollar to my name
My alarm goin off in the mornin, I been snortin all night
I wish that I could hit snooze
Got a song I'm about to leak, I wish that I was enthused
Sick of sittin on the back burner with a lit fuse
They sayin it ain't my turn yet
I'm sick of these music industry
Motherfuckers bullshitin
When the truth is ain't no rapper fuckin with me
I wish I had a tour bus
The car that I be in
Ain't got no air condition and I'm wishin there was wind
I can't afford a shirt I gotta wear this one again
Man I wish someone would send a box of some free shit
I'm wishin I had a bigger buzz
I've been tryin so hard to make it happen with the rap
But for now I make it happen with the drugs
