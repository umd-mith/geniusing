Yeah
Fuck my life, that's how I feel when I wake up
I don't see no light inside this tunnel of mine
My girl just left, I guess that we're gonna break up
I just suppose she fucking around with some other guy
My homies wanna go and kick it, maybe some other time
I'm dead broke and gotta work another double today
My car broke down and tow truck on the way
My boss don't really give a fuck, he wrote me up cause I'm late
He gon' fuck around, and end up gettin' punched in the face
But I gotta control my temper cause I wanna get paid
Fuck this restaurant, I wanna set it ablaze, and take my own life
I’d do it if I wasn't afraid, that I would live
So fuck slittin' my wrists,
cause if
I was dumb enough to commit, I would use a gun
Gloomy getting drunk in my room for months
I know my parents are embarrassed of their loser son
What if I would have done my homework like my sister did?
I would've graduated college like my brother did
And got a house the size of my little cousin's crib
But I complain and blamed it on the drugs we did
And now my partners all resent me cause my stomach is
Sloppy drunk again, beginning to punch and kick
A bunch of holes in the wall
Took another trip into the dark side
Anybody comin' with? I said
Life just ain't that fun to me
Everything around me is crumbling
If you feel the same, then come with me
Cause misery loves company
I said, everybody seems so bubbly
Does anybody feel as bummed as me?
If you do then come with me
Cause misery loves company
Misery loves company, misery loves company
Misery loves company, misery loves company
Fuck these Newports, cause I can't afford them
I'm sick and tired of all my homies wantin' to bum one
It's funny that I use the word bum
Cause if I don't come up soon rapping, I'mma probably become one
I feel like people talk behind my back where I come from
If they supported me I'd be a wrap like a wonton
But every time I stumble upon some critic they call me fat and ugly
Why the fuck I let some dumb kid on the Internet piss me off this much?
I just did discussed it like I lost my touch
They don't realize how many lives are at stake
My fate rides on this, give me some props for once
But when they see me, they gon' wish I had on boxing gloves
Cussing at everybody like I'm some obnoxious drunk
Aimin' the shotguns at 'em like Shawty Fatt, in the “Pop the Trunk” video
Here we go, he lost it, run
The sunshine is gone, can't find no way in the dark
Layin' in the bed, I wake up prayin' to God
Please show me a better way to make it, I'm lost
I thought I found it in my lady but she breakin' my heart
Just entertaining the thought that she is gone for good
It's hard to put on a happy face and just forget
So I pop me a pill, take another trip into the dark side
Anybody comin' with? I said
Dear Lord, is it really all in my head?
Lately I've been thinking I'd be better off dead
I tell my girlfriend, she think I'm playin' I bet
One day she gonna find me dead in our bed
How pathetic I let all this little shit bother me
And I don't mean to be a baby, but I bottle it inside of me
Until I kinda think that I am suicidal and society
Will be a little better minus me
And I don't think that anyone will really miss me when I'm gone
My lady, she can go and suck as many dicks she want
My family photos will be known now without me in 'em
And my friends won't have to talk behind my back and try to front
Like they want me to make it when I know they really don't
They just wanna see me broke unless I can take 'em with
So they can get a free ride, I'm trying to make a grip
Off the sweat and the tears that I put in trying to rap
I just signed a record deal why the fuck am I so pissed?
Maybe I'm just scared I'mma fail and I'm stale
That these industry people don't wanna give me no props
Cause on a scale from 1 to 10 I'm a 12
By myself in a room with a bottle getting drunk as shit
Unhealthy, my livers is acting up again
But fuck that, I'mma chug and take another trip into the dark side
Anybody coming with?
