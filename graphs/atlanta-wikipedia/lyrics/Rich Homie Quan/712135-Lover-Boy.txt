[Intro]
I ain’t trynna love her
I hate she got a man back home
But I ain’t trynna love her, boy
I get money, don’t get mad
Get money, don’t get mad
Get money, don’t get mad
I ain’t trynna cuff her
Yeah, I will never love her boy
Yeah, ‘cause I am not no lover boy
Lover boy, I heard that ass in trouble boy
Yeah, I heard that ass in trouble, boy
I might fuck her, but I will never love her, boy
We call him ass kisser, AKA Lover Boy
I don’t love her if she ain’t got money, boy
And I don’t touch her if they ain’t them hundreds, boy
I don’t cuff her if they ain’t them commas, boy
She wanna fuck me ‘cause her boyfriend is a momma’s boy
She wanna suck me ‘cause she heard I taste like Almond Joy
She can’t stand them broke niggas so she falling for
A real nigga like me, who she calling for
She got a man at home, but I bought that in her closet for her
I red bottom her heels
She turns heads at the press night
Give a fuck how she feels
I Macbook her laptop
Her man get mad ‘cause she playing my song
