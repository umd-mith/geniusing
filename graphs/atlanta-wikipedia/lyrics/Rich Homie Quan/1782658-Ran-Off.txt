I just bought me a brand new rollie, I ball, I swear
I ain’t even walked in the club yet, and I already sold it out the bar
I used to smoke nothing but swisher, now I roll my weed raw
Ass so fat I ain't have no condom boy had to hit that raw
But you gotta know a nigga like me pull it out and I went straight for the mouth
I just want her little potato
If I leave that pussy red like a little tomato
Hide right under the bed, cause her daddy crazy
I rap the 5 like a motherfuckin’ nickle baby
I done made a whole lotta money
I had to stack a onion
My foreign cars are real
Pull up in that 458 spider
That every nigga gon’ hate
Because you know he wanna be us (For real)
I want to touch
She wouldn't let me
I want to fuck
She just be neglecting
I want to love her
I want to wife her
I want to walk down the isle
Your daddy gave me permission
Your momma didn’t wanna listen
Your brother can't stand my guts
Your sister she love my pimpin'
She don’t  know that her friends so freaky
She don’t know that they really love her
She might as well fuck with me, instead of a chicken nugget
I got chicken tender
Ay, where that ranch at, babe?
We could fuck up the mall
Girl and ball like a cancer patient
Hate when a nigga be lying, boy you talking and that aggravate me
Her best friend play baseball in the outfit [?]
[?] put me on and told me a lot of these jewels are fake
I know that your rollie fake
Look at your wrist that shit outdated
us
[?]
I ain’t dappin' for you If I don’t know you
I got 10 bands saran wrapped in a Toyota
