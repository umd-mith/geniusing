Stayed down in the nitty gritty then came up with
My Homie
I got a lot of money and a lot of fame but never changed up on
My Homie
She wanna fuck Quan, she wanna fuck Thug, she might as well be one of the homies
I don't trust girls, I don't love girls, I only love my homie
Gotta buch of love for my homie
She gotta show love to my homie
Tryna get down? my homie
Fuck round get killed by my homie
Play enough game by my my homie
I know they heard about my my homie
Thugger, Thugger my homie
And I'm down for my homie
Run it up with my homie, ambulance your homie
Nigga play with my homie
I'mma let this chopper dance for my homie
Hundred zans, I'm a stoner
Hundred bands and it's on me
Every time a nigga do it
I swear I need a cameraman for these moments
I'mma Matt like Bonner
Cash out like Charlie Sheen when it come to Thugger, Rich Homie
If the bitch ain't got no class you know that's truancy
Rick Ross voice you know it costs to be a boss like me
Thugger smokin' sour weed, I'm like lemon please
Glock 40 my homie
Bankroll my homie
Shittin' on all my old hoes who ain't want me
I made a lot of money but never switched up on my homies
But I done switched girls with my homies
That Porsche truck my homie
That lean plug my homie
If I lose a little bit, get it rich back up
