Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out
This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
While my sister was on stage, killing it like a motherfucker
I was enraged, feeling it like a motherfucker
Bird in a cage, you would never know what I was dealing with
Went our separate ways, but I was happy she was killing it
Bittersweet, she was up, I was down
No lie, I feel good for her, but what do I do now?
Forget the records, off the record, I was going through some bullshit
Post Survivor, she on fire, who wanna hear my bullshit?
Meanwhile this nigga putting his hands on me
I swear y’all don’t know the half of this industry
And it’s almost been a decade
I’m behind them black shades
Roll up like it’s all good, right up out that escalade
Fix my make-up, “Get it together, Kelly, get it together”
Then we make up, well get it together, nigga, get it together
Kinda lucky, I was in her shadow
Phone call from my sister, “what’s the matter?”
She said, “Oh no baby, you gotta leave!”
I’m on the kitchen floor, he took the keys
I was mad at everybody, I mean
Yeah, her, her, her her everybody
Five years later, I got my shit down pat
Think I had it good, and they don’t know how bad
Fooled everybody, except myself
bathing in the dirt
So here I am in the spin cycle we’re coming and we’re going
Nobody can notice
And I was trapped in his house, lying to my mama
Thought it could get no worse as we maximize the drama
Started to call them people on him
I was battered
He hittin the window like it was me, until it shattered
he said, “Don’t nobody love you but me
Not your mama, not your daddy and especially not Bey.”
He turned me against my sister
I missed you
Love is pain and pain is love, he had me fucked up
Love is pain and pain is love, he had me fucked up
