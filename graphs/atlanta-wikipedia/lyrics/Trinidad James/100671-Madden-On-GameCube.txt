[Verse 1: Juke]
She's a freak, I say let your flag fly
They crownin' me king like I was prince, and then my dad died
I'm a bad guy,
I bet she heard that shit from you
Cause you tell her what you feeling,
even if that shit ain't true
That's why you always in some drama, guess you think it's kind of cool
To be the center of attention, all the mentions about you
Word to my tattoos,
I'll be long gone
Getting slow dome listening to my own song
I'm trying to live green, I guess that's why I buy it
Then I set that shit on fire, blow smoke to the o-zone
Trying to learn it as I go,
staring at the blue print
I ask her nasty things, she tells me that she's so into it
then she asked me what's the difference
I say Trini James this nigga' is a bad influence
Hold the hand claps cause I don't want none
My iPhone's got a gold button (Flexin')
Lime-green to match my money
I'm on one so pray for me
Nigga yo' bitch she cum for me
She in good hands nigga' don't worry
What we do is none of your concern
With yo' pussy you in turn
So with yo' pussy it's my turn
I'm arrogant when I want some
I hate a bitch who want no nut
Fuck her so good think she owes something
She says she want a cut, so I said "Let's get faded"
She thought I was a joke, but nah baby, I ain't Ledger
So she slipped off her Cements and started sippin semen
She ain't even breathin' just...(moaning), she goin in
So the next time you on the couch, chillin' lookin' at Netflix
Know that I was in yo' house, giving yo' bitch the business
