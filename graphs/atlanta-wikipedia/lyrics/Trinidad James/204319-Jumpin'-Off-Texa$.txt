[Bridge: Rich Homie Quan & Trinidad James]
Boy I'm 'bout my dollar hate to follow I'm a leader
James up in the crowd while I'm standing on the speakers
Your ho got me fucked up talkin' like I need her
Trinidad look at the crowd and I'm like "watch out for them peoples!"
Aw shit! He bout to:
[Hook: Trinidad James]
Jump up off the stage
Nigga I'm jumpin off the stage
I'm turnt up in this bitch, nigga, I'm jumpin' off the stage (Bitch!)
Jump up off the stage
Nigga I'm jumpin off the stage
I'm turnt up in this bitch, nigga, I'm jumpin' off the stage
[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
Oh lord! These niggas mad!
They seen Rich Homie, then they seen 'dad!
All we get is money, all my bitches bad
Nigga you wanna fight? Then bring yo' ass!
Nigga I'm turnt up, I don't think you know me
You let us in yo' club, we tear it up, call the police!
*sirens* Wait, fuck the po-lice! Wait, fuck the po-lice
Nigga, fuck the po-lice
Came in nigga no shirt

It's a damn shame how these hoes work
They see James and them hoes twerk
It's a damn shame how these hoes work
They see James and them hoes twerk
Buss' it, buss' it, buss' it buss' it buss' it BITCH
[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
The crowd lookin' at me, but I don't do no jumpin'
Trinidad with me, so, that's a whole lot of money homie
You let the swoop charge you for the pussy
And I ain't have to pay to hit it
Stop playing with me, stand up get knocked down
?
It ain't a smart move to fuck dumb bitches
Better watch out, I heard he like to jump off in the crowd
I'm the laid-back type see I might jump off on on the couch
Rollin' on that molly
