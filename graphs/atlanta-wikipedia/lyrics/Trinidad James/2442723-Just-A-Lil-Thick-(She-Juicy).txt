For all my gorgeous, healthy sisters all around the world
I'm talking the 175 and up club
The 'we cook good, we eat good, we look good'
She ain't fat, bruh, she ain't
She ain't fat, bruh, she ain't
She ain't fat, bruh, she ain't
She ain't fat, bruh, she's just a little thick
She ain't fat, bruh, she's just a little thick
Anything the slim hoes can do, she can do it better
Anything the slim hoes can do, she can do it better
[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
I'm talkin' cook, clean, kids, man and swallow the dick
You never see a big ho beggin' for shit
And if you fuck her good she might buy you a whip
And if you say you love her she might pay the rent
You know I'm from Atlanta
Georgia peaches
Cornbread booties
fill up the bleachers
I wanna kick, back up, slap, drop in her pussy
Big girl a freak, man you know that she's with me
pretty teeth
, bitch fuck being skinny
And if your nigga ain't with it then fuck being with him
And if your nigga can't hit it then hit up a nigga
I be off in that pussy like, ooh!
She ain't fat, bruh, she's just a little thick
She ain't fat, bruh, she's just a little thick
She just had a baby and she gained a little weight (Damn straight!)
Bye-bye size 6, 7, and 8
Humpin' a small ass and little titties is out the gate
I'm seein' her later on and she know I'm bringin' a plate
Fuck a water and a salad (Get that shit outta here)
My baby say she need somethin' on her palate
Shit, you should see the way she straddle it
She deserve Texas Roadhouse, fuck Rally's
Yeah, she might be a little round
But she look just like Beyoncé laying down
When she bend over, it's a full moon
Say girl, you gon' fuck around and turn a nigga into a werewolf
LD
Little mama got a body like the guy who got Bin Laden
Fanny on her like a potty
dancer hotter than wasabi
Got me lookin' at the bombs, titties on the Nagasaki
Gotta drop it: kamikaze, magic city, call me Copperfield
Booty flappin' like it wasn't nothin' to a ho'
This bitch named Delicious done took up an interest
I put in some wings
tried to envision
How my dick would fit up in the pussy from the back
Over here just doin' math
I'ma need Ike Newton, Kama Sutra
Martin Luther King Jr for that booty, I can dream
Bitch, get off my foot
