I'm livin' like you should wanna know what I know
Remember this, you will always reap what you sow
Gotta keep it real, hold it down on the low
Never been fearin', nah, nah, nah, nah
So I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know
They say I'm goin' out my head right now
They say I'm gon' fail right now
Maybe you was countin' bands all night
You trappin' out the bando now?
You ain't runnin' the streets, you just runnin' your mouth
I just walk like I talk, got that light to my path
And that lamp to my feet
But the feelin' so sweet, got me feelin' like a beast
A sickness and God as my witness
Boy, the foreign car makin' my pockets pretentious, Lord
Probably plenty of 'em sayin' that they doubt me
Keep them folk from  'round me
Father, keep me grounded
I wouldn't know cause I never be around them, no
20, 50, 100's, stuntin', stuntin', stuntin'
Look what we becomin'
Heard that reaper coming but this what you wanted
So I wouldn’t know
I'm livin' like you should wanna know what I know
Remember this, you will always reap what you sow
Never been fearin', nah, nah, nah, nah
Hundred bands, you got a hundred grand, hundred grand
That is easily a scholarship
You'd rather go the club and blow all of it
I don't wanna judge, but you won't get your honor, yeah
We don't care what you did on the 'gram
Boy, you aborted the mission and I got the sonogram
Haven't you, haven't you noticed
Rappers they flex on the place where they come from
They brag that they eatin' while we got no groceries
Barely Americans really do dream
we marry codeine
Start from the bottom and never do leave, geez
I am for the people, you are for the paper
Breakin' cycles, make disciples that's all that I know
Made it out to make a route
Hate about us makin' clout
See amazin' grace, invading spaces, changin' places
I'm livin' like you should wanna know what I know
I know nothing else
Remember this, you will always reap what you sow
