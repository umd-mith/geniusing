[Verse 1: John Givez]
Tha Side
ready to die for the mission
Or meditate it, then I levitated
You should celebrate it, this is that embedded greatness
I'm a mad man, mathematic-static
Still in the stars
I'm a bad man, bask in the battle
I'm a battered mad hatter with the earth on a platter
Meek and mild 'til I get freakin' wild
It's a misconception messin' with your intellect
I reckon it'll be neck and neck
Before I let the deck eject the message
'Crae, let 'em know the lil' homie willin' and able
Vegas, get active
Flippin' your city like gentrification all in the ghetto upon a dirty mattress
Word to that sister actress
Nevada gets it crackin'
It’s hot and J got a jacket
Pull petals back if you askin' if love’s a long practice
Full metal jacket dually known as a banana clip when rappin'
That's a loaded magazine of ammunition
Plan out snippets so these magazines don't go bananas
Over loaded clips or flows floatin'
Only showin' sinkin' ships 10% of
why he's frozen
Let it go, it's hotter than sprinters in Arizona
Juxtapose 'em to a snowman in Nova Scotia
It's rap's Christopher Nolan
This a misconception triple threat
Did Givens flex? Still a Christian? Yep
Don't need acknowledgement, just respect the conglomerate
Double tap it and follow it
They shocked to see us like Donald Trump up in a taqueria
Watchin' Evita, cryin' over Argentina
Or Maria dominatin' Serena
I'm tryna find a big homie for Slim Jesus
Thesis of a new hope
More hardcore than Star Wars part four rated R
Or Rosa Parks sore feet kicked off the bus exitin' starboard
Light saves like a time change
Hands up and down like a sine wave
Gospel be the humble, don't sleep the beast is a mind frame
They told me to rap: what's that?
Is it tracks, is it facts?
Is it trap, is it rats?
What metaphor? Is you ready for the medic stored inside it
The sinner's lord's inside 'em
I get schizophrenic with sittin', straight jackin' the beat
Blood all on it, #DraculaScheme, trick or treat
It ain’t magic, I'ma vanish when I pass to the team
32
half that
Grab a 16 and let us shoot
Betty Boop wit the black top
I’m a mascot for the dreaded truth
Locks all in my head, ain’t no chain that I hang from
But He hang from where I came from, that’s death
Guess what, I ain’t done
I'm rappin'
Beneath it is Jesus reachin' for actors
Living halle', add the 'lujah with the asterisk
Correction,
then bury the body under the mattress
Livin' my dream while you sleepin' in different caskets
Look, I was created to make a statement
A sentence sent us to earth on this mission
Tryna make a way for my siblings
Brothers and sisters who drinkin'
Out of them cisterns with cracks in 'em
Listen but lack hearin'
Who lookin' but lack vision
Initially made in the Lord's image, dynamic
Now they complaining but how can they be mad at all?
King dreamed a dream but we seen scenes that'll make us all
Change the channel, we channel all of this energy
Pretend to be savages, we ravage our so-called enemies
That look like us
But it look like us ain't gon' make it less we shake it
We can't look back much
Turned around to give a helping hand
I'm like, "Man, they gon' make it, makin' baking soda boiling inside these pans"
Now they're wondering, is it rap or is it Gospel?
Look all you need to know is I was dead, now I'm not though
Real recognizing real, and if they don't love me like Pac
They better respect how I'm movin' and that I'm never gon' stop
I hit my pastor on the cell, I said, "I'm catching hell"
Well, what you think they did to Jesus?
Only time will tell
Tell them other rappers we don't want it, they can have the crown
They have to lay it down when you hear that trumpet sound
We know who got the keys to the kingdom
When the King come, crown Him, and your king dumb if his kingdom ain't bout Him
Say it with your chest, when the bishop is the king and the knight
The queen get the rest
I'm the only pawn that's on one,
back in '01
I was wishin' labels signed me, but now I own one
That ain't braggin', that's just motivation
Get your education, this industry overrated, Satan-saturated
Folk be lyin' to your face, and sayin' they glad you made it
Turn your back and you can hear 'em hatin' in they conversation
Ooh, snake face with the same bait and the same fate
Fake faith will get your face
ate, zero-eight bass
Nah, base like the base plate
How you runnin' home?
You ain’t in that zone, they don’t let it slide
You ain’t safe
Wonder how do we survive in this suicide, do or die jungle?
Let the Spirit lead like He want to
