[Intro: Mathai]
Free from it all
Free from it all, it all, it all, it all, it all, it all
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Round of applause, I pause to take a photo op
None of it’s real, it's just photoshopped
Crop out my flaws then my failures, my aches and all my ailments
Now I'm picture perfect, take all my dirt and conceal it
Really, I no better than any
But they pay me a pretty penny to sit and look pretty
Not too big, not skinny, be whatever these fans demand of me
‘Cause otherwise they probably wouldn't love me
The show goes on even after the curtains close
I smile and pose, put my signature on they clothes
They lift me up so high that I'm surely about to fall
The higher that I go the more unforgivin’ they are
No grace and no exceptions, all they want is perfection
The man in the mirror can't even see his reflection
You live for their acceptance, you die from their rejection
But even if I fall, I fell in the right direction

[Hook 1: Mathai]
Cameras flash, the curtains call, the credits roll down the screen
Critics laugh, they hate us all, as they applaud
But should I fall
I’m still free from it all, it all, it all, it all, it all

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Life is a cage, a prison of everyone's approval
Fight for acceptance and struggle so you don't ever lose it
But livin’ for their acceptance has got us stressin'
Insecure people obsessed with leaving impressions
Ladies spending time on they faces, painting pretty lines
To you and me its make-up, but to her it’s a disguise
You look her in her eyes and see her soul cry
‘Cause livin' for other people’s got her living a lie
Hadn’t slept in day, close his eyes and he pray
Someone would miss him if he fell like a star out of space
But I'm sure they'll replace him, just a name and a face
They say they love you, but it's easy to fall from their graces
Live for everyone else gotcha losin’ yourself
Why be slave when you were made to be free from the guilt?
To be free from the shame, you are more than a name
If you go down you got the freedom to get up again

[Hook 1]

[Bridge: Lecrae & Mathai]
Every moment is passing, just let ‘em go
In fifty years, man, who cares? We’ll be super old
Many winners will lose, many heroes will fall
And if that’s me I’m still (free from it all, free from it all)

[Hook 2: Mathai]
Cameras flash, the curtains call, the credits roll down the screen
Critics laugh, they hate us all, as they applaud
But should I fall
Cameras flash, the curtains fall I'm still
But should I fall
Cameras flash, the curtains fall
I'm still free from it all, free from it all, all, it all

[Outro: Mathai]
Free from it all
Free from it all
Free from it all, it all, it all, it all, it all, it all
