We can live it........
We can live it, that good life
Yeah, so we can live it
Yeah, that good life
That good life
Now, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, good life
Never pulled a 187, but he preach it like a reverend
Never satisfied with second
Except for second home, second car
Second woman his own, second bottle from the bar
Good life, even though he got it, he don't get it
Cause he living for the moment, but this moment has an ending
Caught up in an all-consuming flame
All alone, still rejecting Jesus' Name
Grandma told him 'bout living water, he prefer the sewage
He don't know why he do it, desire just enslaved him
Addicted to himself, do whatever just to praise him
Give himself the money, pleasure and treasure that'll rust
When he traded his eternity for 20 years of lust
Where the bottles go pop, models go shop
Everyone knows who you are
But then the lights turn on, curtains fall off
You see it all was false
But that's the good life
Lights, camera, action
Where is the satisfaction?
Good life...
Black diamonds and gold
Living highest when you live on the low
I take the narrow route, that speedway's a monster
It's all good, I go to sleep without a guilty conscience
For that they call me conscious,
but I'm very conscious
Of what I'm missing, I ain't tripping on the girls in VIP
Fronting for each other
They actin' like they something that they not, they undercover
Trying to get under covers, but one day they'll discover
They gave parts of themselves away that they'll never recover
A part time lover, took a full-time pay
God please show her mercy, her affliction's here to stay
She just found out she pregnant and the child has been infected
my Lord
What's worse is that, she'll never meet the guy that she rejected
The one that can protect her, comfort her to the grave
And resurrect her body to live with Jesus who saves
Can't say that God ain't love her, she wanted to be a slave
50 years from now, he may be full of gray hair, beard long
And even closer to a home that he's never known
Right now his home facing 25-to life
Sitting in the county jail,
If this case is Tina Turner, homie, I am not Ike
Got his momma crying daily but she praying every night
Only 20 but there's plenty that he's paying with his rights
Thought he got a life sentence but he really got life
He done read that bible twice
Been in plenty fights, sleepless nights
But when he trusted Christ you could see that change overnight
Knew he'd die in prison but was living for another life
Every time his lights out he closer to the other side
Partners on the outside think he found religion as a
Coping mechanism when he say the Lord's risen
Now he lay awake in prison, praying for his homies in the streets
Cause truth is, he's free-er than they gon' ever be....
We can live it, that good life
Yeah, so we can live it
Yeah, that good life
That good life
Now, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, we can live it
Yeah, good life
