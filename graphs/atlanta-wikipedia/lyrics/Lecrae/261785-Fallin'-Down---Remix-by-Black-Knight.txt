It's going down, down, down
It's going down, down, down
Hey, I know you think you the one, homie
It's going down, down, down
It's going down, down, down
But can’t nobody escape gravity
(It's the Black Knight)
[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
It's going down, down, down
Yes sir, it’s about to go down
It’s spiralin’ to the ground, but I don’t think it’s gon’ slow down
This fallen world is fallin’, this building’s ‘bout to blow down
We just goin’ in circles, we don’t get another go ‘round
What happens when your life is leveled, bro?
A storm is comin’, can’t nobody’s levees hold
It’s heavy, bro, but I gotta let you know
It’ll help you look beyond this world like a telescope
Yeah, stack your money in the air
‘Til it’s rainin’ hund’eds all around your atmosphere
You can build a mansion sky high
‘Til can’t nobody see the roof when they drive by
But death’ll hit you like a drive by
And to that stuff you acquired you gotta say, “Bye, bye” (leggo, peace)
I ain’t gon’ lie, you might go down in history
Everything will go down eventually
Everything is falling
Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down
[Hook: Trip Lee & (Lecrae)]
It’s goin’ down
(It's goin' down, I see the sky fallin’)
It’s goin’ down
(It's goin' down, and ain’t no way to solve it)
It’s goin’ down
(It's goin' down, I hear the Lord calling)
It's goin' down
It's goin' down
It's goin' down

[Verse 2: Swoope]
It’s goin’ down, rather comin’ down wit’ it
Cold world, condition is sin, here is the illness
It’s sickenin’, affliction so erotic, sickness so hypnotic
Desirin’ this virus even though we know it’s toxic
Godless, hallowin’ the gods that is counterfeit
We live from ‘de party o’ ‘de dearly departed (leggo)
The darkness is flowing from my nostrils
We’re so psychotic, we still partyin’ like we not sick (leggo)
YOLO, homie, so pour another glass
Roll another one up, let’s put on another mask
Another bundle o’ cash, another shorty to bag
Same thing everyday, groundhog under grass
Turn the music up cause ya' don’t wanna hear the truth
‘Bout the things I’m living for is dead and I’m the living proof (leggo)
Shoot, the sky’s fallin’, ain’t no need to panic
Unless we party ‘til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin’ coming down
[Bridge]
[Hook]
[Interlude: Lecrae]
You scared, I’m not
There’s a time for everything
A time to be born and a time to die
There’s a time when the world as we know it will end
When that is, I don’t know
But it is goin’ down

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Listen, it’s goin’ down, down, down holla’ “Mayday!”
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Ain’t playin’ Modern Warfare. Don't you know ain’t a war fair?
Scales never even, but they be triple beamin’
They keep them fiends fienin’, the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin’, but ain’t no hope here
Ain’t no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here
Oh yeah! Them Christians in Christian Audigier
Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say?
‘Cause everything is fallen, it can happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and ain’t no way to get away
You ain’t never gon’ say you ain’t hear it from Lecrae, crae
If I die before I wake I pray to the Lord your soul He'll take, take
All these drunken nights are empty like the bottles that we break
And you can't get high enough to escape
It's going down!
[Bridge]
[Hook]
It's goin' down, down, down
It's goin' down, down, down
{I see the sky fallin'}
It's goin' down, down, down
{I see the sky fallin'}
It's goin' down, down, down
{I see, I see the sky fallin'}
It's goin' down, down, down
{I, I, I see the sky fallin'}
It's goin' down, down, down
