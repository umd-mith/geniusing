[Intro: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Dark past full of evil endeavors
Heart clean never, black and ugly as ever
However, I seen my family die from them rocks
Them fiends on blocks, including my own pops
Homie, I seen two much to drink them two cups
Can't lean on the lean, already way too screwed up
Was way too gone, I was way too cold
Fifty yard Hail Mary, I was way too thrown
I was Tarzan, raised by gorillas and the beasts
High on them trees when I gorilla the beats
Then that truth came hit me, took me outta my grave
All my partners say I'm changed, how I'm going stay the same, huh?

[Hook 1: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Killa, tryna murder it chasing ladies down for fun
Saying, "Come with me", Hail Mary but then kill her son
However, I seen them boys man, take that bar and wait for God say?
Beastie boy, he still took three the hard way?
Toss me up, Hardaway, crucifix no jewelry
These wooden beams he took from me
Took them up to Calvary while I was a DGK
Whylin out to UGK, runnin' from the HPD
Huffin puffin Mary Jane, no Rick James man
I was looking for a super freak
Nasty, cameo, candy, super sweet
But now your boy turnt up, free from all them chains
Volume on ten, you can call it unashamed

[Hook 2: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Now I'm turnt up daily, I'm on my one-eighty
They thought I'd water it down, I'm like boy y'all crazy
On my J.O., my O.J. Mayo, I'm on my Grizzly
Jesus turned me 'round me so fast that you would swear I was dizzy
Now they askin, "Who is he?" Now they wonderin' my name
I run in my own lane screaming, "Jesus is King!"
Till my heart stop pumpin, no more blood in my veins
Watch me turn up everyday, homeboy, I'm so unashamed!

[Bridge: Lecrae & Tedashii]
Turn up boy, turn up boy
Turn up boy, turn up
Turn up boy, turn up boy
Turn up boy, turn up
Turn up boy, turn up boy
Turn up boy, turn up
Turn up boy, turn up boy
Turn up boy, turn up

[Hook 3: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son
[Outro: Michael W. Smith]
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
