(I Know) (x6)
[Lecrae]
(I'm foolish
Two lips)

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
(Who gon' give 'em peace of mind? They can have piece of mine
Know they thinkin' I'm blind, but I just pay them no mind
Yeah I know they be lyin', they misquoting my lines
They like what you think you doin' putting hope in your rhymes?
You would think I'm shooting folk or putting coke in my rhymes
I just give them bass for free and push the dopest of lines
Boy you trippin'
'Crae you slippin'
I done heard this all before just sit back enjoy the show)

(I know) (x3)
[Verse 2: Skrillex]
A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you can hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all
[Hook]
[Lecrae]
(Strew your
Told me)
To my Creator
Big ups to my Creator

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
(Yeah I know they gon' hate us, type they blogs up debate us
They be fishin' for attention but don't know how to bait us
Keep that hate on hiatus
Big ups to my Creator
No big bang just a banger, so tell that DJ to bang it!)
Yeah
(Listen, I kno, they tryin' to find out my MO
I tell them God sent me they probably ain't get the memo (I know)
Boy they swear I went loco, 116 still my logo
Catch us rollin' in that Volvo, gon snap you a photo

(I know) (x2)
[Verse 4: Ellie Goulding]
A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you can hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all
