[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Awakened from my slumber by the thunder, lightnin' clappin'
Rainin' on my window pane and prayin' I make somethin' happen
A preacher's prophecies never bothered me when I was younger
Sittin' on my grandma's lap, as she cried I often wondered
What was her tears for? Could it be for my grandfather?
Or maybe she felt for me cause I see more of those cold tomorrows
Then she see the world will up and turn on me
Cause the morals that she often spoke were meant for 1923
I fall asleep off in her arms, a Psalm was spoken
The Lord is surely my shepherd, he lead me to the water
Thought that often stuck with me
Amongst the wolves that run the streets
Out here paying dues to lose
I pray your angels come for me
A non-believer I never have and never could be
Lord give me time to peep the signs I should see
Sippin' got me feeling like a player ridin' clean
Bendin' corners hopin' I might find my saviour on the curb
I rarely go to Church
False prophets rockin' Prada so I rarely feel the word
Jezebels lurkin' in the pews on the first
Preacher's weaker than the deacon cause it's hard to fight the urge
It's hard to live and serve when you on the devil's turf
Sell your soul for the low with no sense of what it's worth
Don't get it twisted, I ain't no saint, I ain't no pastor
But prayer ain't just for cloudy days and natural disasters
Aware of what comes after, I bet you ain't for sure
I was warned that Heaven ain't the only place to go
I'm doin' what I can cause there really ain't much time
I leave this in the Lord hands
I'm tired of cryin'
[Hook: Ashton Jones]
Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down to be another (man down)
Hope and pray and say and you can turn (man down)
Help is just one prayer away
Don’t be afraid to say, “Mayday”
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Am I bias? I been pious put my nose up in the pews
Like Paul I bear good news
They think I'm pall-bearin'
My message sounds like death to these hearers as they perish
Scary to think we on the brink of death
But no one stops to look for answers on what happens next
Got a couple scriptures from my grandma, sayings from a preacher
But can't live out these standards that we heard it takes to reach 'em
But when I look at Jesus, He lived the life I couldn't
Suffered for my crime so I wouldn't
I used to have to sneak into the movies cause I couldn't afford to pay
Explain to me how someone paid my way
When I hear K.R.I.T. confessing, I respect him
Cause most of us be lyin' like our lives don't need perfecting
Nothin' that we can muster, nothin' that we can change
Admittin' that we're imperfect, offending God with our games
Look I'm just being honest so don't take me for no lame
I seen it for myself, I'm a product of this thing
Now I found true religion, and it's not inside a denim
And them overpriced shades have never given us vision
Let's go

[Hook]
