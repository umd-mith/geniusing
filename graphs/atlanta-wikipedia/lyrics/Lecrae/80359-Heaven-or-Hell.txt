Nah dawg, let me pose a question to ya
Have ya heard of my Dad?
He purchased us back, puttin' man's curse on his back
I worship for that, its my whole purpose in fact
Purple and black, is how He looked
I'm certain of that
And man I cry when I hear of how the curtain was cracked
And since He created and saved me
I serve Him for that
I read His Word all the time so He stay on my mind
When its time to go to Heaven I don't pray I'm in line
I'm 100 percent positive, I'm waitin' for mine
Ain't no if's and's or but's, who's or what's
I hope you're all listening well
There's only 2 places to dwell
(Heaven or Hell)
And if you're representin' the first
I pray you're representin' it well
(Heaven or Hell)
Lives can be fixed through Christ, I'm a witness
And I don't care about 5 mikes or a hit list
I'm gettin' kinda used to gettin' dissed as a Christian, dawg
Let's get one thing straight
Out the gate, I'm the type of dude that'll put a slab of truth on your plate
I don't care if ya heard it twice
I ain't trippin' if ya just left church- ya heard of Christ?
Let me tell ya what was told to me
6 hours on a cross while His holy blood flowed for me
What ya know about a sacrifice
Would ya step off a throne for the same one that snatched your life?
Hey yo, I might I to bleed for this
I'm not ashamed of Christ, there's Romans 1:16 for this
And I don't care if I'm blinded dawg
Every time I trip and fall I just be reminded dawg
And ya call yourself grindin' dawg?
You can serve more birds than churches but your still dyin', dawg
I don't care what city you from-
Whether from the suburbs or slums Christ still gonna come
Matter of fact if He come now
You can be a 6'8" heavy-weight but your knees gon' bow
Ain't no tellin' Him to ease on down
And the trumpet sound and BLAT!
Everybody see that ground
I don't care about fame or wealth
Put my God on a shelf?
Nah dawg, I'd rather hang myself
Forgive me if I can't contain myself
Cause if you died and didn't hear the Gospel
I'd blame myself
