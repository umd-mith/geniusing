[Intro: Don Cannon]
Hey, Coach, I think I'm ready
The wait is over (Cannon, Cannon)
It's about time I suit up
(the Cannon)
See I been a menace since season one (the Cannon)
So we hard to gear up for season two
Only difference is...the army got stronger
Uh-oh I done woke up
Slept on me trying to eat with vultures
Ya'll look frail, lemme feed the culture
Can't get full off the lead and coke, huh?
Still sober? Y'all OD, follow me
Wanna reign, follow me
(King!) ya'll know the (King!)
Martin Luther (King!)
You ain't really on a throne, boy you in a dream
Wake up, wake up, y'all don't want it
Down to The Wire, better put Marlo on it
And el es un chico malo, homey
And if I'm scared, I guess I don't know it
Cause I'm still going
Still right where the heat at
And where I ain't supposed to be
That's where I be at
And I spit that, sit back
Listen to the truth
'Fore the sky crack and the Lord gets back
Or somebody want some hit back
And they click-clack, they be bent back
Leaking out that syntax
Never left but I been back
And I don't rap Gospel, I live that
But I'm nothin' but a gimmick?
See me in a club
Funny, you was in it?
Skip a co-sign shout out to the homie Kendrick
And all I hear is crickets
When I run into the critics
(Oh well) it sure tells me a lot
When they tell me to rock
Keep my eyebrows raised smell what I'm cookin'?
And the sales may drop
Yeah, the mail may stop
But they ask for the truth
(Yeah then I'mma do it)
They like "how you do dat dair?"
Sounds kinda nice, boy "who dat dair?"
Is everything real, good, true and fair?
But you prob'ly wouldn't listen
If you knew "dat dair"
There's nothing you could do or say to me
To knock me off my square
The Reach Records empire
The number one co-signer Don Cannon
(the Cannon, the Cannon)
Creepin' out the lions' den
So really all it takes
Is a little training camp
And the attributes go right back up
A hundred wins, no losses
I think that sound about right

Church Clothes 2
The wait is finally over
