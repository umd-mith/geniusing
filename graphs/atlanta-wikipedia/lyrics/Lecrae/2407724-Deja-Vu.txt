Never thought that I would see the day
When I would have to pray for God to hold me down
Cause Lord, I feel like giving up today
I feel like giving up the faith
I swear these people fake, I swear they full of hate
I swear to tell the truth 'til I'm in the grave
Shots-shots fired, everybody quiet
Tryna hear the preacher, he ain't preachin' to the choir
Preachin' to the riots that he got fired
He ain't got no medicare, sippin' liquor in his chair
Blank stare, need a blank check, where your bank at?
Babies had a birthday, they gon' need a rain check
Rich man need a vacation, hop a plane
Broke man need a vacation, Mary Jane
Walk outside and everything is lovely
Butterflies in my stomach from this girl I wanna see
Party in the neighborhood and everybody on the street
They was on that Stevie Wonder now it's Frankie Beverly
I done seen days go crazy, time fly by
Maybe it was yesterday or maybe 65
Peace then war, sworn in, die
All too familiar, more lifetimes
One time for the memories, two times for the crew
Three times for the love, y'all
And Four times for the truth
And some days are a nightmare
And some dreams come true
But the Lord's still right there
It's just déjà vu
It's just déjà vu, déjà vu
It's just déjà vu, y'all
It's just déjà vu
It feel like Tribe Called Quest, it feel like De La Soul
It feel all too familiar, it feel like déjà vu
I said I love you, hit the door
Got a mission, gotta go
Yeah, it's cold, but I'm gon' pursue that
She said she love me but she know
I'm too old to be waiting for handout, boy you knew that
And if they try to keep me down
Hold my ground 'til they all look around
And they wonder, "Who that?"
They don't respect my mind, they'll respect my grind
Now maybe I was talkin' to my lady
But I think I told my mama same thing
I told her I was all about the action
And then I got Ghostface in my dream
Déjà vu, parlez-vous français? Quoi de neuf?
Everything the same under the sun, that's why we burnin' up
Don't believe astrology, but man, I hated cancer
Breast, lung, throat, blood, prayin' for an answer
Seem like it was yesterday, they came and took your breath away
And I ain't get a chance to tell you everything I want to say
Now they say your sister got it too
Yeah, they say it's true
Guess it's never finished til it's you
Déjà vu
