You probably watching like man I never heard of him
I murder him
The nerve of him
Rocking with Pre-Premier that’s so absurd of him
Wait until he spit a couple verbs at them
If you really wanna hate wait, he got the Word with him
I heard em holla “Jesus the Notorious” no
The most glorious homie
So laborious
Boring us with these choruses
Horrible at it’s core
It’s just killing us, call the coroner
Unimpressive ain't flooring us
Hey this what happen when hip-hop let the saints in
Tailored to snatch the mic swiftly like Ye did
But them awards can’t follow you to the grave
You living for them whips and chains then you a slave
Uh, prayer don’t stop time, it kills hours
They looking for a savior, but we killed ours
Still he rose like Derrick, no bull
You wanna meet the Lord? Come holla I got pull
