I never fit in I was a outcast
In grade school out blasting my Outkast
And I'll pass on running to catch a route pass
Gimme a pen and a pad I'm tryna outlast
All of my idols
American and the foreign-ers
Before the foreign cars & the boring bars
Money, money, money, sex, drugs and the coroners
All this killin' but where the bodies at
All this money where the Bugattis at
But dig a lil deeper
And you'll find another insecure man sittin' in a 2 seater
The same little boy that got beat up
Plenty pains in his past you could bring up
Nobody ever told him he could be more than he is
But inside he's a leader
I didn't know who was inside me either
Striving to be a captain
Hopin' I could date a cheerleader
Tryna get me a throne of my own so I could put my feet up
Thank God my kingdom was overthrown by the soul redeemer
[Outro]
Yeah, anomaly
Deviation from the common rule
Something or somebody that’s abnormal
That doesn’t fit in
I say that’s exactly what we are
We are the odd, the outcasts, the peculiar, the strangers
And they say we don’t fit in
But I say we are exactly who God created us to be
Anomalies
The system didn't plan for this
