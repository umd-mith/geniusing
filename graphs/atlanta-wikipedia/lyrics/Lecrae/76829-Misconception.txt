I'll leave your brain stimulated
[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Slang came from a land were they suffer from the effects of depravity
Like gang banging and earthquakes
Most famous no-namers split a brain and plant a taste for the King of Kings
I know it's a strange concept
Peddling redemption boy what more can I say
Make me and Lecrae been trying to make Him famous since nine tre
Filling these 58′s with phrases that would deem us
Unfit to succeed among these heathens
It's so crucial in the belly of the crucible
That you would understand that stage like your morning candle
It's handing out cancer
That's why fame was never the aim
And the back is the front
Homie left side up
That's a concept
[Hook]
Misconception
Those deadly habits have me losing my cool...
It's what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated...
[Verse 2: Braille]
So many misconceptions
Missing the mark, misdirected
Driving reckless and aggressive
Fueled by our false perceptions
Our methods need corrections
Spitting venom in their face
And violate the ones we should protect as an attempt to motivate
Neglect our obligations place the blame on someone else
Point out the flaws in other people and take the focus off ourselves
Those who have been abused view leadership as illegitimate
So they don't think it's necessary to play by the rules or submit
They see authority as nothing more than a power trip
And they don't want to be plugged in to it
They'd rather see that power stripped, get it? Power strip
It's unfortunate
Disproportionate
The door is wide open for false teachers to twist the truth and distort it
No examples left to follow
left to our demise
Acting foolish but can't see it so we're wise in our own eyes
The life and crucifixion of Christ is a beautiful depiction
Of service and submission within a leadership position
[Verse 3: Odd Thomas]
You probably have it all figured out, right?
Like you're the type that believes that if you act right
Then that just might make you righteous in God's sight
You've been a really good person
You followed the good book as much as you could
You probably didn't go to church as much as you should
But it's all good
I mean you never really killed anybody
Never really steal from anybody
You never lusted much, or did much, touching of any bodies
You never use the Lord's name in vain, and you respect you neighbor
You try to maintain peace, love your enemies and not hold on to anger
You really believe that you could receive God's favor by your good deeds and right behavior
But you're dead in your transgressions
and need a savior
Cause you could never win God's approval -
Of the removal of sinful discretions, your righteous acts in removing God's wrath is in fact the biggest misconception
[Verse 4: Lecrae]
Since my conception I've been riddled with deception
Televised lies devised to lead a blind insurrection
Against the resurrection
And the greatest misconception
The world believes the Christian is foolish without direction
And they knock it to knock it
But what does it profit a prophet to be socially ostracized
And no we ain’t stopping the mocking
But if there is anything I can do to raise the stock in the market
For a Biblical worldview then there's no longer an option
Here with the humble beast, ain't no subtleties, ain't no tongue-in-cheek, this is what I mean
They don't understand anything about the faith I believe, and they want to belittle me
But it's cool though, They just want the pseudo
The fake faith
The false one
The western God that's man made and not the Biblical Awesome
Toss 'em,
pick up the Reasons for God by Timothy Keller and read it
There is a God you should believe in and his name is Jesus
