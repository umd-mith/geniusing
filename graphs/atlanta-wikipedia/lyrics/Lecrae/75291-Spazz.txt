Spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz
I make this spazz
Spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz
I make this spazz on em, knowing that they don’t know me
I may call up homies, 40 deep that's how we rollin'
We pull up on your block and we ain’t got no Glock 40's
No Nina millimeter, hope you never have to meet her
this one right here’s a heater
Tryin’ to get off in my zone, watch me hit these wide receivers
If you ain’t a believer, I’m looking for conversion
My 16 is a sermon, get you hands up in this service
I know to bring that realness, so hard I got to kill this
That 808 up heavy, my adrenaline got me sweaty
I
’m Leo DiCaprio, I’m gone, departed
This ain't for the faint of heart, it may be for the heartless
The way I eat this beat, you'd think I was a starving artist
Boy, it’s hard to hold this back, it’s hard to keep this in
This spazzing feel so right, not to do it is a sin
Nah, I ain’t got to be wildin' and I ain’t got to be jumpin’
But you feel them walls humming, that's my people coming
Now they ain’t smoking that good, ain't finna do nothing bad
But they on that Jesus juice so they probably gonna spazz
' 116, see it tatted on they wrist
Cause they ain’t ashamed of nothing mane they get it how they live
old us is dead, the new us so legit
Got us spazzin' in the game, cause we know we about to win
But truth be told I done found it, I'm gucci, I'm gold
I’m better than I ever been that truth that hit me settled in
I’m spazzin on these people they don’t want it, but they getting it!
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz

[Outro]
I might just spazz
I-I-I might just spazz
