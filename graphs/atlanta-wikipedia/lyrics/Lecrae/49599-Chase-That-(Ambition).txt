Started with hanging posters on my bedroom walls
To battle rapping for status up in the school halls
Just call me double sushi, thought I was too raw
And hip hop was my home, I had my shoes off
6’3” in high school, well skip my hoop dream
If I don’t blow up then maybe, I’ll try the school thing
I went to college
to do my family a favor
But I couldn’t pick a major cause I wanted to be major
I tried sellin work, but it didn’t work
So I worked, shopping center clerk, finna go berserk
Lunch break , see my writing 16’s over Micky D’s
Skipping class, making beats over 60 keys
And I love that, that even though I’m just chasin'
Selfish ambition couldn’t tell your boy nothin'
Watch out all you rappers’ cause they 'finna le' ‘Crae in
But I was sleeping on the Son like the Days Inn
Ay you can have the money
And you can have the fame
But me I want the Glory
I’m living for the Name
See life is just a picture
I see outside the frame
I'm living for a kingdom that I ain't never seen
And I'mma chase that
Glory I'mma I'mma chase that
Found the key to life and best believe that I'mma play that
Glory I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that
Glory I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that
I remember chasing the green feeling blue
Only check I’m counting is the mic check, one, two
All I wanted was the money and the fame and the new
Somebody on my arm when I walk inside the room
All I wanted was doom
The same kind Alexander the Great felt
When the Earth ran out of room
He conquered all he could, but yet he’s feelin' consumed
By this never ending quest for glory he couldn’t fuel
Like a typical fool, I would go hard
Shootin' for the moon
But there only one son, no co-star
Chasin' glory I shouldn’t own
Instead of livin' to make His name known
I’m runnin' after his throne
I thought being on TV where everybody could see me
Was nothing short of the easiest way I could see to please me
I’ll never be who I used to desperately want to be
I’m too worried 'bout the Lord getting credit instead of me
Ay you can have the money
And you can have the fame
But me I want the Glory
I’m living for the Name
See life is just a picture
I see outside the frame
I'm living for a Kingdom that I ain't never seen
I use to wanna do it big
When you’re only focused on yourself that’s small
And they, they use to tell me as a kid
That I could do anything that I want except fall
And now that I recall
I was chasing my goals
And every time I caught em they multiplied into mo’
I never even thought about whether the Lord approved
Call it selfish ambition
I call it, I'm making moves
But history repeats itself
Evil’s what it is
Lucifer
was cast away for doing what I did
Created by the God who spoke the Earth into existence
Instead of chasing the Father’s glory he was chasing his
He lies to us all
Told Adam he could ball
“Why you following God when you could go get it all?”
I’ll tell you what's better, or better yet worse
Chasing your own glory by doing the Lord’s work
So holla if it hurts
But we were made for greater
Our greatest satisfaction is making His Name famous
So if we’re never named among the greatest
They don’t critically acclaim us
Ain't nothing to be ashamed of
We gave it up for the Savior
And the Lord’s goodness
You should-you should taste that
And you ain't living until you're living for his name
Yeah, Glory I'mma chase that, I'mma I'mma chase that
