[Verse 1]
Boy I lost and I'm foolish, running off at the two lips
Prolly wooing all the cruelest persecutors to fool us
Catch me hanging with shooters rumored to strew your medulla
My momma told me they would screw us but I already knew it
Who gon give 'em peace of mind? They can have piece of mine
Know they thinkin' I'm blind, but I just pay them no mind
Yeah I know they be lyin', they misquoting my lines
They like what you think you doin' putting hope in your rhymes?
You would think I'm shooting folk or putting coke in my rhymes
I just give them bass for free and push the dopest of lines
Boy you trippin' (I know)
'Crae you slippin' (I know)
I done heard this all before just sit back enjoy the show
Yeah I know they gon' hate us, type they blogs up debate us
They be fishin' for attention but don't know how to bait us
Keep that hate on hiatus
Big ups to my Creator
No big bang just a banger, so tell that DJ to bang it!
I know (x8)
I know what they sayin' but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin' but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin' I ain't trippin' on it man
I just came to do my thing, something different for a change
Listen, I kno, they tryin' to find out my MO
I tell them God sent me they probably ain't get the memo (I know)
I can't say that cause Jesus Walks, they don't play that (I know)
Shouldn't be here cause people rollin' they trees here (I know)
You can't help em, no strippers and killers welcome (I know)
You can't hear it, no ignorance in my lyrics
Boy they swear I went loco, 116 still my logo
Catch us rollin' in that Volvo, gon snap you a photo
Maybe Andy or Pro though, might see Trip in De Soto
Maybe KB, maybe T-Dot, yeah I know you don't know though
Yeah I know they don't like me, cause I be on my Spike Lee
Even when I do the right thing, they still wanna fight me
IRS want they taxes, police stop us in traffic
Plus my girl be on my back, she say my life is so hectic
Crae they watchin (I know), Ay they takin (I know)
I done seen this before, this just part of the show, let's go
I know what they sayin' but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin' I ain't trippin' on it mane
I just came to do my thing, something different for a change
I Know (x8)
