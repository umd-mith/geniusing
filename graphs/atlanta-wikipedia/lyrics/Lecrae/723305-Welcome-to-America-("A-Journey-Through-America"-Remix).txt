[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from the flight deck
We're cruising at 37,000 feet and we just passed over the coast We'll be beginning our descent in about 30 minutes
I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to America
[Sample]
O beautiful
For spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
[Richard Nixon]
I want to say this to the television audience. I made my mistakes, but in all of my years of public life, I have never profited
Because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got
[John F. Kennedy]
And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country
[Martin Luther King Jr.]
When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of that old Negro spiritual, Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
I was made in America
Land of the free, home of the brave
And right up under your nose
You might see a sex slave being traded
And we'll do anything for the money
Boy, a mama might sell her babies
Sell porn, sell pills
Anything to pay the bills
Anything to bring that pay
Gotta scratch that itch
Gotta scratch them ticks
Ain't rich, but I might be
And I'mma shoot these flicks, I'mma turn these tricks
Anything for a slight fee
Yeah made in America
Momma told me that I belong here
Had to earn our stripes, had to learn our rights
Had to fight for a home here
But I wouldn't know a thing about that
All I know is drugs and rap
I probably could have been some kinda doctor
Instead of holding guns and crack
I was born in the mainland
Great-Grandpa from a strange land
He was stripped away and given bricks to lay
I guess you could say he a slave here
But I was made in America
So I don’t know a thing about that
All I know is Uncle Sam looking for me working on his corner
So I know I gotta pay tax
Getting paid in America
I was raised in America
And this is all I ever known
If I'm wrong then you better come save me America (America, America)
[Harvey Presnell (Gen. George C. Marshall)]
It's with the most profound sense of joy that I write to inform you your son, Private James Ryan, is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from European battlefields. Reports from the front indicate James did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication, even after he was informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression
[Verse 2]
Man I'd die for America
I served my time for America
Got shot-shot back went to war
Got back and ain't nobody give a jack in America
I could lost my life boy I lost my wife
I can’t even get right in my home land
Cold sweats, whole ticks, paranoia
Looking out for a threat in own land
I was trained in America
How they get up in the planes in America
Flew them right into the buildings
Taking out civilians
People getting killed in America?
And I’m still in America
Though America ain't feeling me
I went to war for this country
Turn around came home and you drilling me
When y’all free here saying you don’t wanna be here
Boy you probably couldn't breathe here
If I didn't load a couple magazines here
Y’all just complain in America
I’m jumping out of military planes from America
Aye, I was made in America
That's why I’m out here saving America
I got a brother in the cemetery now
Cause he wanted y’all safe
And everybody want the freedom but nobody want to hear "about face!"
We bled for America
To keep y’all fed in America
But what's the point of talking
A lot of y’all don’t really even care America
[Verse 3]
I wish I lived in America
Wanna raise my kids in America
Heard everybody rich
All I gotta do is run, jump, kick
I'm a hit in your area
So please pick me America
I know you probably never loved me
You never hear about me on the news
And you probably never been to my country
I hear you selling education and got clothes that you throw away
Got plenty food in your nation
I could tell cause a lot of y'all are overweight
I already work for y'all
I'm at a sweatshops making these shirts for y'all
Naw, I ain't gettin' money
Go to bed hungry, but I make some exports for y'all
But y'all don't know a thing about that
You was made in America
I'm trying to find me a ticket where the sky is the limit
Catch a plane to America
It should be plain to America
Y'all blessed and you got it made
Heard y'all don’t pray no more, y'all ain't saved no more
Y'all looking for another way
Well I hope it ain't true, but I'm packing my suit
Farewell to my mother land
Said bye to my loved ones
Fate here I come, I'm going to another land
I done made it to America
I'm amazed at America
But I couldn't get approval to stay so they sent me away from America
I Pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the Untied States of America
And to the republic, for which it stands, one nation under *beep*
Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all
*clapping*
One nation under *beep* (x4)
*Beep* (x7)
