Bought a Phantom cause I always wanted one
Made a film with them bitches, ain’t no one-on-one
Got this watch, and this watch like a one of one(thats pique)
All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one
Have a few chains on, I don’t have but one
Bought a few houses and I never sleep at one
And I can have ten cars and I wouldn’t drive one
And when you make it from the bottom you the chosen one
Rich nigga since birth, Louis V chinchilla
Bought a brand new Rover, drive it like a four wheeler
Solid gold AP, flooded out with them crystals
Shinning just like molly,
I woke up in a new bugatti
Im a young rich nigga from the bottom I came up and I can’t lose
Bought a Phantom cause I always wanted one
Made a film with them bitches, ain’t no one-on-one
Got this watch, and this watch like a one of one(thats pique)
All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one
Have a few chains on, I don’t have but one
Bought a few houses and I never sleep at one
And I can have ten cars and I wouldn’t drive one
And when you make it from the bottom you the chosen one
Guilty by association that’s a lie (Liar)
How dare you make that accusation I’m an A1 nigga
multi-faceted business owner hustler
Work pump it up inflation, run your numbers up
Extra point escalation, how you spell dedication
What you know about determination?
Salute the BET, appreciate your nomination
RI double A, appreciate my certification
Got a job for a hater -- where your application?
All that hating shit, really admiration
Bought a Phantom cause I always wanted one
Made a film with them bitches, ain’t no one-on-one
Got this watch, and this watch like a one of one(thats pique)
All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one
