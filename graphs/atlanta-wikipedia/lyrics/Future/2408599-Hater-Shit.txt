Hook
Little nigga take your bitch with all that hating shit
Audemar, my wrist, fuck that hating shit
Pucci on my bitch, fuck that hating shit
They tried to count me out, nigga I'm staying lit
Fuck around, took a loss then I planned this
Ain't taking no shots, nigga I'm mad rich
Made myself a boss, nigga and I'm savage
Lean talking that talk, I don't put a address on it
Full grown 36 zones, ain't no flex on it
Here come another one, all we do is win, win
I'ma cash out on the Spider
El Chapo my idol
My watch as a chain, it's a brighter
Hot as a flame, a lighter
Audemar, my wrist, fuck that hating shit
Pucci on my bitch, fuck that hating shit
In the 'partment, I was in your baby momma
In the 'partment, I was in your baby momma
On the carpet, I was hitting your baby momma
Took the carbine with the 50 round drum
I'm a Martian, I'm really 1 of 1
I pull up where ever I want, I do whatever I want
You take her on dates and I won't
You holding her hand and I won't
You do whatever I won't... and I do whatever I want
I got her mouth when I want , she let me hit when I want
You like the tricking, I won't
You claiming that bitch and I won't
Audemar, my wrist, fuck that hating shit
Pucci on my bitch, fuck that hating shit
