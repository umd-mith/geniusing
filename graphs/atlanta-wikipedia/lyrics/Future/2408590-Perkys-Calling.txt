Wizard
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you, savage
Gon' roll it up my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, squeeze the trigger
Gon' roll it up my nigga
Roll up, hop out the car, squeeze the trigger
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the perkys callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the xannies callin'
I can hear the perkys callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Thinkin' about that cash like it's fast food
I'm thinkin' about this cash like it's fast food
I'm payin' all my tithes, receivin' bad news
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know this cash rules
Everything around me
turn to fast food
Standin' in the cold I got no blanket
These hoes always gettin' exposed, ain't got home trainin'
And when I push up in that Rolls and I'm still drankin'
Went from standin' over stoves to the tour bus
Stayed down ten toes aboard the G5
So much yellow gold on me like a beehive
Started rockin' Balmain's like they Levi's
Over time the booth is like a gold mine
I served in Alabama like roll tide
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the perkys callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear the perkys callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
Aquafina water got me glistenin'
When I whip that Beamer can't you picture me rollin'
Fuck you pussy niggas, ain't no sympathy
Niggas tellin' lies, they so feminine
I be sellin' pies, chasin' M&M's
Fuck a 9 to 5, get it out the gym
Push illegal weight, we call it out the gym
Knock 'em off on tape, that's murder on film
I need better thoughts, I need better vibes
Focus on the top and let my nigga slide
I need more advice and ain't got no time
Hustlin' do it right, feel like I waited a life time
Weigh up both sides cause your life ain't like mines
Pay me no mind, I ain't payin' no fine
Everything I did was for my hood this whole time
I'm talkin' this whole time, for my hood this whole time
Gotta take advantage, gotta learn how to take advantage, dog
Stole a golf cart, I go and buy a ballpark
Drove a stolen car and now my car push start
I'm from apartments, my crib big like Wal-Mart
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the perkys callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the xannies callin'
I can hear the perkys callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
Gon' roll it up my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, squeeze the trigger
Gon' roll it up my nigga
Roll up, hop out the car, squeeze the trigger
