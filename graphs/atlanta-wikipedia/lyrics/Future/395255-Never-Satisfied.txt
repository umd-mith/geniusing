​No matter what you do, it's never enough
​I don’t understand these bitches, Drizzy
​Trying though, they ain't never satisfied
​Time after time after time
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
​But I ain't never satisfied
Yeah, I ain't never satisfied
​I found the one and say, "I'll never cheat again"
​We don’t talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied, I ain't never satisfied
I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied
And it's a lot of money in the room
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied
​Time after time after time
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
​But I ain't never satisfied
Yeah, I ain't never satisfied
​I found the one and say, "I'll never cheat again"
​We don’t talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied, I ain't never satisfied
