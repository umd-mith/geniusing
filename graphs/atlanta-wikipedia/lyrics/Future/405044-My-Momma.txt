Godzilla ain't got shit on me, nigga
[Hook: Future]
My momma ain't raised no ho
My niggas they wrap that dough
These niggas ain't got no hope
They runnin' and kickin' in doors
My momma ain't raised no ho

My daddy had bust him a nut
Keep a .45 tucked in the gut
Fuck what you thought nigga, fuck what you mean
Sippin' on promethazine
Fuck what you mean we be gettin' to this cream
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
We don't give a fuck about the bitch
I just went got me another bitch
I just went bought me a better bitch
Tricking ain't nothing but a habit, smoking on some of that Cali
Enjoying my life to the fullest, the fuck you mean nigga?
Yeah I'm a money machine nigga
These bitches try out for my team nigga
She making a wish and I'm making a list
She didn't know real niggas like this exist
She's complementing me on my Givenchy kicks
Check out my, check out my, check out my wrist
Audemar Piguet is clean clean
That mean it ain't got no diamonds in it
GT Bentley and it's limo tinted
Free my niggas in the penitentiary
Future Hendrix limited edition
Fuck you mean nigga? Fuck you mean?
Pulling up in something European
Fell in love with a lot of green

All the money I'm making, come easy, you comfortable slaving
Fuck is you saying? Fuck is you doing? Take her to dinner

T.G.O.D., that's my company
