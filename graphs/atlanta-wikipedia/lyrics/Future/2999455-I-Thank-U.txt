Pluto
I can see it written all over your face
You doubted me from the first day
And it never went away
So I say this...
Girl I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I wanna thank you, I need to thank you
'Cause you made me a hustler
You not a part of my destiny, I tell ya
I was just servin' that fishscale in lobbies, yeah
This money comes faster than a mothafucka and it's obvious
Pour some more syrup on me
Throw some more dirt on me
But I'ma never give up
They got it heated, now we undefeated
Comin' so conceited, but I really need it
Eight figures, big tippers
Allen Temple
I'm in the Hills tryna find peace
These Bel Air neighbors so nosy
Black Draco, got me cozy
