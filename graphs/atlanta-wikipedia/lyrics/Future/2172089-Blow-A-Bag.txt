Yeah
I woke up feeling like fucking up some paper
Freebandz, Freebandz
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I had a bag today, I blow the bag today
I had to grab the Wraith, I had to grab the Wraith
I had to change the safe, I had to change my bitch
Money'll change a nigga, the fame'll change a bitch
I know for sure, for sure
If my granddad was livin', I know he'd be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Snupe was living, I know he'd be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Lonzo was livin', he never would've doubted me
I know for sure, for sure
I live with these diamonds, just check out my clarity
Gotta just check out these clarity
I get so fly like a parachute
I pull up right now and embarrass you
I sold the crack on my avenue
Only the strong survive
I'm just enjoying my life
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hope out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I ran it up with the same niggas
Get that money and stay with the same niggas
I know that money can change niggas
They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
Hop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it
Sell all the dope out them apartments, I did it
I'm 'bout to cut off some niggas I know that ain't with me
Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas
That get it and niggas who strive
And the real niggas is all they come across, yeah
I know either way it goes, Sunny gon' be there
I know either way it goes, Doe Boy gon' be there (Young Metro!)
Even when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there
I be pourin' up this 4, they thought we wouldn't be here
I told you, come a time when we had to persevere
I knew there'd come a time when we'd all be here
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
Future Hendrix
It's red bottoms when you walk to me
Come here and talk to me
You gon' make me throw the racks on you, baby, aye
