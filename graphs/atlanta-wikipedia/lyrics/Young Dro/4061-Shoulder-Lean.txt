Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
Dro, I'm clean in this bitch
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this bitch
carbon 15
Grand Hustle
team of kings is getting rich
I lean and get lit,
lima bean 6
I take breath, the opposite of Primatene Mist
I ride twenty-six and let my nine screens flip
Dro be watching Oprah, Mac 9 up in a clip
Triple black Phantom, nigga, nah, it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charms, diamonds, man, but nah, it ain't Flip
Can't bounce, okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork and beans
Everybody know me in the club cause they smoking me
Dro, hoes scoping me, ice come from Boca Raton
Hundred karats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm riding Deion
Our cars look like cra-yon, hoes know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean, I don't know how to dance though
First, I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
How can I pimp a ho? Take a bitch to Berlin
My bitch break niggas, after that we fuck they girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Arm & Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimping in linen and salamander sandals
Dirty South hot cause Atlanta,
We ride Phantom,
Yep, now I be on TV, BET our channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumping and punking monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Donut Dunkin', bitch, I ride glazed on the Haze
Gator green Chevy, gator guts, alligator Js
