All ready, all ready, all ready, all ready drunk
But the bottles keep coming
Told her start dancing
But her booty still jumping
Keep shaking like that
Then you gonna have to fuck something
Ask where the money at
But they a'int talking about nothing
They a'int talkin abou nothin
I've been fuckin these hoes gettin money ever since I was a young nigga
I had hustled
And they a'int even know i've been ballin ever since I was a young nigga
Bitch wanna fuck, then i'ma let her fuck get wet I'ma pass it to my young nigga
I don't give a fuck
About none of this shit right now I'ma do it for my young niggas
Young nigga get money. Young nigga get money
Y'all niggas get some money(x6)
Bitch wanna get a nigga FaceTime and I a'int talkin iPhone6
Told her drop booty to the baseline, make her look like she gettin this dick
Instagram stalkin see me gettin mine, type of money make your boyfriend sick
Bunch of gold chains and a wrist watch, lookin like an all gold brick
I might pull up in some shit you never seen before
Walk up in some shit you can't pronounce
In the club free thrownin' doing brisk coke
Throw some money make your baby momma bounce
I took a croc pot and learned to make crack rock
Made a little change in the dope game
I think i'm only makin money off of hip-hop
Rich nigga but a nigga a'int in rich game
I got the type of molly to make yo momma heart stop
Hood nigga what you doin out in south beach
In the winter I'ma pull up in a drop top
