Maaaaaaaaan, get out my way and watch out as I come through
Bustin' in your line, crackin' helmets in two
I bring the pain, so what'cha gone do?
Stand there and just get shook out your shoes
So clean out your locker, I'm out to get'cha
Cuz I just popped ya, you can't take the pressure
You might as well quit, cuz you just can't last
Madden two thou put your face in the grass
And your spine in the Dirt, so put on a Skirt
If you step on the field and don't wanna get Hurt
Just bruised and beaten, all black and blue
And it's been like that since Madden '92
EA Sports, it's in the game, what'cha want?
(The rock in the palm of my hands!!!)
