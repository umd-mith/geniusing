Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Get yo ass up baby get your ass up
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
In the middle of the club blowin endo
Rolling up a swishers sweet, fat as Mr Winslow
I came to shatter haters dreams kill they self esteem
Don't try to make it now my niggas this ain't maybelline
And now I ain't gay so I don't care if niggas like me
Bitches know I'm cooler and I rock like Mikey
I, I, I rock things way out of your price range
We don't look at price tags never will never have
When you see my chick you see a chick that you will never have
And that's a concept you will never grasp
I'm the shit fertilizer in that greener grass
'm bout to eat rama down watch these niggas fast
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
My momma asked me is the bragging really necessary
I say no but this shitt is gonna make me legendary
And I apologize for cussing, but when it come to rap I don't apologize for nothing
These rap niggas rerun I'm yelling what's happening
When you niggas dis me you ain't gettin no reaction
Cause emotions is for women and niggas who just be sittin when they pissin
No we on like the opposite of off
With TI get some Andre, Hov, and some Kanye
So how can they make saying Donnis ain't the illest where even the hottest niggas consider the boy a menace
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
