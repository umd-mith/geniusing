[Intro]
Mama, MAMA!
(Wha, What!)
You get that money out my pants last night?
(Boy! Naw I ain't get no money out yo pants! And quit yellin' at me!!)
Ain't nobody hollin' at you!
I had a dream that rap wouldn't work
I woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
I got Medusa on my sneakers
My dick up like "nice to meet ya"
100K for a feature,
hundred K's at my leisure
Then we aim at your people
I be higher than a eagle
When I'm sipping on that codeine
Free my nigga Sigel
Ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa
Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa
If I die tonight, you gon' see some flexin' ghostas
I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota
Man I'm running up that check, show you how I do it
I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls
Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some
my trap house is my income
So much money on me, it won't even fold
2 Chainz!
I'm ballin' like Mr. Clean
I gotta keep my kitchen clean
God bless me like I'm finna sneeze
Doctor weigh me on a triple beam
D-boy in parenthesis
2 Chainz, two pinky rings
Climax!
I'm so high, your whore get hijacked
And my vision is Pyrex
I do it big like a 5X
Killed they ass with the eyepatch
I got bad bitches on my side
I done fucked around and got sidetracked
My first night, I spent five stacks
Next night I forgot to count
I'm so hot; who gon' put the fire out?
I'm the fireman, I put fire out
Got a pole in my basement
Tipped your girl like Maliah now
My wrist deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, wrist?"
My stove deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, stove?"
All this jewelry on then I'm out cold
So much money on me, it won't even fold!
