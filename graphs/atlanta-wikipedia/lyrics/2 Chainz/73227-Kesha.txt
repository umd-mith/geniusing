[Intro: Ke$ha]
I am in love, with what we are, not what we should be, and
I am in love, with what we are, not what we should be, and
I am in love, with what we are, not what we should be, and
I love your ass, naw for real I love your ass
You done got a little thick but I like to hug your ass
Yea your momma don't like me don't give a damn
What I do remain like a ceiling fan
I'm cool
and I like to spend on ya
When you with me you don't really need employment
We make love like chemist when we penetrating
When I first met you girl I was intimidated
You all sophisticated
And you educated and you know I like to run I'mma paper chaser
So before we get married I'mma tell you this
Your my wife before and after it
Start chest to chest then I make you touch your ankles
My hair knotty
Star spangled banner yea I pledge allegiance
Two chains on and they are anomic
I like red pussy when that body brown
And yeah on that loud not that Bobby Brown
Put her face in the pillow she won't make a sound
Every time I take a shot I'm tryna make it count
And if she get sad I might buy a bag
And if she get mad I might buy a jag
Glad we had a little girl so it can trickle down
Woke up this morning I feel good as fuck
If your girl wit me you know she good as fuck
And I can't even lie that pussy good as fuck
First I pick her up then take her home and pick her up
