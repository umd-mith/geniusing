[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on exotic, my girl ain't got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I ask her is she working, she ask me do I want it
I say when I went to school bitch money was the subject

[Hook]

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around on my side of town, boxing gloves I beat the trial
I had the coke I had a smile, I had a coat for every style
Crocodile the gator type, I'm allergic to the hater type
I take ya wife, give her back, 9 months after that, SIMILAC!
Similar the saying, mama's baby daddy's maybe
When we had sex I was in a Mercedes
And I ain't crazy, but if that's my baby
Then we gonna have to name the little baby Mercedes
The money that I'm making I don't see you like I'm blind
My pockets on full, and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray
[Hook]
them suckers know they don't want none
Steady repping that one son, Bankhead
Got a quarter-mil in my Louis bag if you wanna know what that sack 'bout
I got Striver's Row in my denim tag and Akoo shit, new kicks
Supersport on deuces
[Hook]
