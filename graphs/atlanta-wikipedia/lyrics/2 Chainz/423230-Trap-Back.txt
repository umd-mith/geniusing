Listen up, fuck niggas
Let em' know I'm still up in this bitch poppin'
Do so many shows in arenas, my nigga, I need me a locker
Look at my car, how did it get on them sixes?
This flow come from Drizzy
He got it from Migos, they got it from Three 6
Look at my bitches, look at my wristses
Realest nigga in the game, my nigga,
ain't no counterfeited
Bitches is thick and delicious, doing they dishes
100 million on my wishlist
Taking penitentiary chances, just to drink lean in them Benzes
I want my trap back, I said I want my trap back
I'm from apartments
Used to walk around with work in my backpack
G's all on that shit, G's all in that bitch
12 calling me by my government
Running shit, gunning, she shopping in London and loving it
- I, oh, okay, I think we've had enough... here
- Shush up for one second. You shu-shu-shut. Shut your mouth
- I needed someone to move the--
- Wait, shut your mouth. Shu-shut your--shut your mouth
- I'm sorry. What did you just say?
- You're just coming off stupid
- I'm coming off as stupid? You're wearing tuxedos to a job that requires you to clean bathrooms. Please leave this office, we're done with this interview
- Do we get any sort of souvenir?
- GET OUT OF MY OFFICE!
I want my trap back, I said I want my trap back
You niggas ain't talking about shit, Harley Levin
You would've thought that there was some
Kilos on my bus but they didn't find a thing
Hair, man, like Brillo
my flow Armadillo
Catch me first class on Delta with Versace all in my pillow
I been seen a kilo, the dope man my hero
Remember I had that Box Chevy? I set that bitch on some P zeros
You know that I'm rocking Buscemis
and I'm as raw as sashimi
Her head is so cold, my nigga, I think that she gon' need a beanie
Rolling and smoking zucchini
dropping the top on the whips
Making them look like bikinis
I am now balling so hard, I should be on my own boxes of Wheaties, ugh
