I met her in Miami, she say she from Atlanta
And she like to drink and like to smoke my reefer too

And she a college girl sophomore I hit her in the dorm
On the hard floor she got her shit together so I respect her more
So if she ask me for some money she is not a whore

And she layin with her forehead on my six pack
