[Hook: D'Banj]
Im getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!
[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Okay I’m chillin’ in my camo, flippin’ through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo’s a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I’m pitching
To make your body switch another position
And listen, my weed loud
fuck her and speed off
Tell 'em I bare arms, I'm cuttin my sleeves off
Lettin' my tats show
Im letting my ass show,
I'm hot as tabasco
I study, Castro, yeah, my plug from Cuba
Inside of the car is like a damn computer
Inside of the crib is like a damn museum
Tryin to take these fat pockets, man your chances are slim
Disrespect, you stomp em out, man give em a Tim
And they dont have slow-motion so I did it again
[Hook: D'Banj]
Im getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!
Okay I'm sittin' on the plane, flying over graves
I am so high, nigga I can talk to rain
My outfit's insane, ain't that evident?
My chain had another chain like it was pregnant
My favorite dish is turkey lasagna
Even my pajamas designer
She got a fat ass I make her rewind
Back seat so big I press recline
Got a dirty sprite in my cup holder
Rappers like road kill, they get run over
They get done over, it's just one solider
This flow will make you fall like its October
Me and your girl, nigga opposite of sober
Celine Paris chain charm look like a cobra
Young Casanova, Baby Romeo
I got my girl geeked, she look like she from Tokyo
[Hook: D'Banj]
Im getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!
