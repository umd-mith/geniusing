I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it's mine I spend it

It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I am smoking on exotic, my girl ain’t got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I say when I went to school bitch money was the subject!
I'm ridin round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it

I'm ridin' round my side of town, boxing gloves, I beat the trial
I had the coke, I had a smile,
I had a coat for every style
Crocodile the gator type,
I'm allergic to the hater type
I'll take ya wife, give her back, 9 months after that SIMILAC!
Similar to saying mama's babydaddy maybe uhh
When we had sex I was in the Mercedes
And I ain't crazy but if that’s my baby
Then we gonna have to name that lil baby Mercedes
The money that I makin' I don’t see ya like I'm blind
I rather spend money baby I don’t spend time
My pocket’s on full and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it

Pho-to ready my polo out the cleaners
Maserati, Kawasaki, bought my girl a beamer
The jewelry I got on is matchin' with the tequila
Patron, margaritas, double for my divas
I bring all my guns to work, Gilbert Arenas
I should have sex in the coffin’ cause I’m killin' these hoes
Fulfilling these goals, climbin' up the ladder
Shoot your ass down you know I rep Atlanta (Southside!)
I'm ridin' around stuntin',
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it’s mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
