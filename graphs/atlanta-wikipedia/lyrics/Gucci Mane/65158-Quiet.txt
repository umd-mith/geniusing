Do anybody know somebody who know somebody?
Who know somebody who know somebody who got the mollys
Karate Kid but I don't even know karate
Kush got my eyes low like Mr. Miyagi
East Atlanta Santa,
yeah my stomach fat and jolly
Got the battle of the bands going in my Robin's
And if you think of robbin Gucci, you gon have some problems..
Servin pizza pies, and all my pies got extra toppings
And I be shittin on all these niggas just like pigeon droppings
30 grand in all hundreds, I don't do the wallet
And I'm about to fly to New York cause I'm going shoppin
I take a brick, break off a brick and cook a deuce
Way I'm beating up all these babies call it child abuse
white girl
Quiet, quiet, cause I be being quiet
I let my money talk for me because I'm being quiet
Break a 4-way off a brick and then I'm bout to fry it
My money gettin obese, your shit is on a diet
I sip lean all day every day until the kid is tired
I make em search 'em 'fore they enter cause these pussy's wired
If you think you can defeat me, fuck it nigga, try it
I got squares all in my trunk I think he wanna buy it
Got a G-4 but I do not have no one to fly it
I'm so fly that I might stop rappin and be a pilot
Gucci Mane the shit and you can't deny it
I got the game in a knot and you can't untie it
