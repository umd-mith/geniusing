Trap House 3, fuck nigga
Men we outta cut again?
Fuck
I told partner bring the presser
Apply some pressure to the jack
Guaranteed I make this money stack, nigga
I'm trying to make the money fast, nigga
I'm trying to keep this shit together
I call that boy eggbeater fast
I cook good, but he cook way better
Sipping Coronas with my vato
Me casa you know es su casa
Big cat we used to call el gato
Now GuWop they call me El Chapo nigga
I use to trap out all the bandos
Abandoned homes with boarded windows
Who the fuck that is peeking in my window
Fuck boys know I keep that extendo
Trap house 3 got a K with me
And 3 young niggas that stay with me
Trap house 3 got a K with me
And 3 young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Cause my Mak 90 stay with me
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
You know I got me an agenda
Break that thing up in my blender
Got a warrant, no surrender
Sub-machine with that extender
I came up on a pissy mattress
I got more money then all these rappers
Tried to hit me up in traffic
But I had to work my magic
I'm riding round with my lieutenant
I let 'em count it and I spend it
Bitches come after my business
Catching bodies in these trenches
