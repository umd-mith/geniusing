[Intro]
What's happening?
Everybody looking
I love my kids
[Hook]
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
Don't nobody love you like pa love you
Don't nobody love you like Guwop love you
I had to make a track to say I'm proud of you
Stop that track to tell my children that I'm proud of them
Making rockstars out of trap boys
And if we never talk again, still got your back boy
This here is bigger than the game, deeper than rap, boy
Just ask around in East Atlanta, I'm the landlord
Fuck a contract, I'd rather shake your hand boy
Yeah I'm your CEO but I'm your biggest fan boy
Said I'm the best A&R that's in the business (It's Gucci)
But there's an AR-15 in my bentley
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
I'm laid back, feet up, watching all my rugrats
Gucci got more money than all these rappers
Guwop got more money than all these trappers
I can take a dope boy and make him go platinum
But how a drug dealer from East Atlanta go platinum?
Master P, '93, mixed with a lil Eazy-E
Dancing in the video like Puff cause I got plenty G's
My young nigga's gonna ride with me
All my niggas gonna die with me
And all my kids bust five with me
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
