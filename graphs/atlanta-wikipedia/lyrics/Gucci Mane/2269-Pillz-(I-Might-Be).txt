Zaytoven on the track
We goin' to the club we got the choppers on deck and the yoppers on deck
Is you rollin'
Bitch I might be
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy 'til yo' bitch came in
'Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinkin this Buffie The Body
Ain't yo' name lil' Trina? Cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid man I love the way you flowin
Ridin' in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin'
On two eighty five I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
"Gucci, show time!" Give me five mo' minutes
And a cold orange juice, cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and requested "I'm Da Man"
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubber bands
Is you rollin'
Bitch I might be
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be
Shawty tellin me she ain't neva suck no dick
Neva took a pill or neva ate a bitch
You a lie but I ain't gonna get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you married, well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't icy like me
With them dopeman Nikes and them Jordache jeans
I don't pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
I'm the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves thats three
Ain't no waffle house baby, hell I can't eat
Wearing Dolce's in the club cause you know the boy geeked
We've been rollin rollin rollin we ain't slept in weeks
Is you rollin'
Bitch I might be
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be
Gucci Mane La Flare, nigga get your mind right
Order Cris by the twelve like a case of Bud Light
Sell kush by the bale so you kno might shit tight
7:30 in the morning on an all-night flight
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gonna party
Got a party pack of pills thats at least bout 40
I'll pour them in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pills, call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pills man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill; that's a damn good deal
Is you rollin'
Bitch I might be
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be
