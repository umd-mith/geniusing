Fishscale all over my motherfucking apartment
Damn, I got dope all on garment
Cooking dope in Trestletree
Sun Valley
I’m so fresh, don’t need a stylist
Buy a rental car and tint the windows
Buy a car, stop the mileage
Stuffing bricks all in a fender
Stuffing P's in the spare tire
Gucci ain’t real, you a damn liar
Serve more chicken than Popeye’s
Strong purp, Popeye
One day I might die, but not soon because I’m strapped fool
I got old schools, I got new schools, I got one rule — don’t cross me
Red bottoms on my feet, courtside next to Spike Lee
Baby, I’m Spike Lee
All the purple, all the white
All this green,
taking a flight
Up all night, nigga getting shot
Nigga getting popped, Big Guwap
Drop my top, suicide doors
Pouring up fours, just bought me a Rolls
Money over hoes, recycling your clothes
You niggas going broke, I’m sure of my goals
Little Mexico we cook up dope
If a nigga broke, we sell him soap
I can see it in your eyes that you niggas going broke
‘Cause you don’t got no pres no mo’
He used to buy bricks, now he buyin’ a fo’
Money over bitches, can’t wife no ho
Place your order, I’ll be there over night
I’m talking private planes
Hundred bricks of white
Still a young nigga
I live a mob life
