I move chicks
Rap about Gucci stay strapped with a uzi
eatin Justin's by Tuesday
It's Gucci Mane excuse me, dog, I'm makin my music
I did six months, incident with a pool stick
They found a nigga guilty, still say I didn't do shit
Major league, minor league, was independent
I moved on shawty, Gucci handled his business
And I ain't goin back to jail, God is my witness
I'm grillin so hard it look like it's a picnic
I'm whippin up the gravy the fiends say that it's tasty
I'm up 980,
soldier scrap like the Navy
It's fuck you pay me, bitch what you done lately
I growed up crazy boy, 1980
A true trap baby bitch the dope game made me
The streets raised me, I drove my kinfolks crazy
From start to the finish, Gucci Mane the apprentice
So every word, letter, ad-lib, every sentence
Is perfectly place period and indented
Crazy color diamonds they got me shinin (true)
The charts are climbin off a cut like Tyson
I'm big coupe driving but got no license
Lames talk senseless, G's you silence
And you can use peace, dog, but I use violence
And your stones cloudy so you're not ballin
My Down South swag got the fine hoes callin
My swag's on Northern and my grill so 'Nawlins
My Down South swag got the fine hoes callin
My swag's on Northern and my grill so 'Nawlins
