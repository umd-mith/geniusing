Making love to the money I swear the sex great
Kick them hoes out but let the money stay
Making love to the money like a sextape
I'm talking Kim K, I'm talking Ray J
Making love to money on the interstate
Can't keep my hands off her, we on a dinner date
I'm making love to my money shawty keep me straight
I can't live without her, I fuck her everyday
Shawty stayed by my side when I started grinding
She the main reason why a nigga shining
Strippers can't see me all this money flying
30 years old, talking bout retiring
I'm a show these hoes who the King of Shine is
Soon as I walk in the king of diamonds
She broke up with me once almost had me crying
She know I was cheating cause she caught me lying
King of the jungle I'm a lion
White lion in the house we named it Miley Cyrus
She never talk back baby very private
Got me talking shit but she kinda quiet
I gotta take her everywhere cause these niggas crazy
Only leave her by herself on special occasions
When I bring her to the club them hoes be going crazy
Every nigga in the hood wanna fuck my lady
Can't wait for me to slip so they can take my baby
She gets me outta jams and tight situations
Well fuck it they ain't gotta fuck with me at all
I pick my baby up and took her to the mall
Now baby ain't no angel but she a keeper
Before she dealt with me she dealt with some real evil people
She bought me AK's call it Desert Eagles
And she don't never lie to me she keep it real
Yo bitch keep coming short my bitch keep wearing heels
She keep on standing tall she never stand me up
She'll go to war with anybody she don't give a fuck
So I keep her on my mind like a skull cap (Gucci)
