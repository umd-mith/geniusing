I'm hearing shooters load pistols while I'm brushing my teeth
I get so many death threats it's getting normal to me
But I bend don't break, I don't ask just take
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives
Main focus every day is make it out here alive
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes
Last night I had a dream some killers ran in my room
Trying to be patient but nigga I can't wait
chase
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em
I can't say
You either with me, or against me
Or you in my way
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed em
Then they might turn on me
Feel like I don't need em
I keep the best pedigree but hell I don't breed em
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame 'em
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em
I did some things to some people that was down right evil
Is it karma coming back to me, so much drama
My own mama turned her back on me
And that's my mama
Black gloves and black tape, nigga it's my first day
Wop, Wop, Wop, Wop, Wop
Fuck you, fuck you
Pussy
Wop, Wop, Wop, Wop
