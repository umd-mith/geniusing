I know what she like
I know what she like in the morning!
When she’s lonely
I like it when she moanin'
When she on it
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?
She like it when I tickle that
When I sit it on her back
She like it when I toss that ass
Or flip her like a acrobat
She dig it when I dig in that
Squeeze that ass she pleased with that
She like it when I make her lose her mind
I never said a word...
I'mma leave with that, gon creep with that
Gon sleep with that, Make her pay a fee for that
She like the way I tax that ass, wax that ass
Now bring it back
Them legs cocked, knees bent, face off in my pillow
Bitch

She like it in the mornin
I know what she like

When she’s lonely
I like it when she’s…
When she’s..
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?
Six o’clock in the mornin
I wake up to head
She’s my alarm clock
My breakfast in bed

In the morning
