You know I go by the name Nitti right (uh huh)
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad right(who this nigga mane)
This nigga go by the name of Joc (Joc?)
He resides in Collegepark (Collegepark C.P.)
But for right now, what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)
Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what you do (OK)
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Verse number two, do the damn thing
Cubes on my neck,
pockets full of Ben Frank's
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work, make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic, seven days a week
Number one record, long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me, better yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew, we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout thirty-five cars
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's
Girls liking girls, time to recruit
If ya' got a problem, say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Time to set it off, let these nigga know
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya' see the buckets on my feet
Fans
on my trail, but they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean casue I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask me how I know, its me, surprise
Put it in the air, rep where ya' stay
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'mma make it rain nigga, I ain't scared to share it
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Yung Joc...
Nitty strikes again
This a Nitti beat
Playmaker
So So Def motherfucker
