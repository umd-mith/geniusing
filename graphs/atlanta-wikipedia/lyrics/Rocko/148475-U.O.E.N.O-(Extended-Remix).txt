[Intro: Future]
U.O.E.N.O it
Ol’ high class niggas
This shit sound crazy
Fly shit only
You know what I’m sayin’?

[Hook: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don’t even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
I came up from bottom, you don’t even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don’t even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don’t even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don’t even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don’t even know it

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Ay that monster truck, sit tall as fuck, it’s so big can’t even tow it
Don’t like snakes keep my grass cut, so low can’t even mow it
Sip Dom Perri’, little high glow, no no we don’t do Moet
If it ain’t P.J., no Rose from me ho, so don’t even pour it
Specks on Tom Ford, button-down Michael Kors
Always on like the refrigerator, I’m plugged in, ho, you know it
AP and that PK, wear a Breitling when I’m bored
Got a Masterpiece and a 41-millimeter, and you ain’t even know it
Keep the .45 in my pocket: ain’t gon’ show it ’til I have to pop it
Then you gone know it, damn who shot you, they don’t even know it
Hawks game f-ckin’ floor it, TV seat front row it
Rocko Da Don CEO it, ain’t gotta rap and you know it

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
That nigga sold you that re-rock, you ain't even know it
I die over these Reeboks, you ain't even know it
Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain’t even know it
I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it
Got a hundred acres I live on, you ain't even know it
Got a hundred rounds in this AR, you ain't even know it
Got a bag of bitches I play with, on cloud 9 in my spaceship
Zoned out but he stay fresh from Zone 1 through Zone 6
Bricks all in my blood, birds all in my dreams
Boats all in my yard, lemon pepper my wings
I’m bout to get you fuck niggas wacked, you ain't even know it
Your main nigga bout to turn his back, you ain't even know it

[Hook: Future]
Been rich for 'bout a year now, you ain't even know it
Had a long talk with my accountant, I ain't even blow it
The whole game bit my shit, you ain't even know it
A$AP on the remix, you ain't even know it
I say these niggas, need lord - got a crib they can't even afford
In the club lookin' all bored
Show 'em your money, you ain't even throw it
And that crib you don't even own it
That lean, you ain't even pour it
Every bad bitch dream about my dick, you ain't even know it
She poppin' and droppin' it lower
Droppin' it down to the floor
hoping you, score,
She asked about my journey as she sat upon my lap
I said "I'm fresh up out the slums but I ain't never going back"
You ain't know?
We've got a lot of marijuana
If you see me you got a problem
Run up on me like you want it
Guaranteed we're gonna solve it
They'll be thinkin' someone shot him
Hit him with a bottle
Started from the bottom
Now my diamonds looking autumn
And I'll show you lil' niggas you can get it if you want it
U-O-E-N-O...
That good weed you don't even blow
See I drank so much Bombay in here tonight, can't even drive
And that head feel so good to me that I can't even lie
See me all up on the curb, you think I'm drunk when I'm swerving
See you ask how much it cost, you niggas got a lot of nerve
Phantom Rolls Royce curtains
Roll one more and that's curtains
Young Khalifa, that's curtains
In Taylor Gang we worship
Got tats all on my skin, up to my forehead
Tryna hide all this pain, I don’t wanna show it
I’m about my dollars, I Creflo it
What’s the use of havin' that ass if you ain’t gon' throw it? (tell ‘em)
I say throw that ass (throw that ass…)
Got the city on my back right now, I’mma need shoulder pads
In every photograph I take – picture
Niggas know I got them priors – Richard
Jealous niggas I despise – pistol
And if she a cutie-pie, I’ll eat you
Got half a key in my car, you don’t even know it
I don’t have a key to my car, that bitch foreign
Ammunition on me, I Rambo it
Watch me swag over this beat, I’m flamboyant
[Verse 6: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin’, you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin’, you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don’t even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don’t even know it
