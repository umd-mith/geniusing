[Verse 1]
We're dancing free, but we're stuck here underground
And everybody trying to figure they way out
Hey hey hey hey, all we ever wanted to say
Was chased erased and then thrown away
And day to day, we live in a daze
[Bridge]
We march all around til' the sun goes down
night children
Broken dreams, no sunshine,
endless crimes
we long for freedom (for freedom)
You're free but in your mind, your freedom's in a bind
[Hook]
Oh make it rain, ain't a thing in the sky to fall
(The silver bullet's in your hand and the war's heating up)
And when the truth goes BANG the shouts splatter out
(Revolutionize your lives and find a way out)
And when you're growing down instead of growing up
(You gotta ooo ah ah like a panther)
Tell me are you bold enough to reach for love?
(Na na na...)
He lived in sector ten
He had a friend named Benjamin
Sail away, sail away Susan
So strong for so long
All I wanna do is sing my simple song
Square or round, rich or poor
At the end of day and night all we want is more
I keep my feet on solid ground and use my wings when storms come around
I keep my feet on solid ground for freedom
You're free but in your mind, your freedom's in a bind
[Hook]
Oh make it rain, ain't a thing in the sky to fall
(The silver bullet's in your hand and the war's heating up)
And when the truth goes BANG the shouts splatter out
(Revolutionize your lives and find a way out)
And when you're growing down instead of growing up
(You gotta ooo ah ah like a panther)
Tell me are you bold enough to reach for love?
(Na na na...)

Plastic sweat, metal skin
Metallic tears, mannequin

And when the world just treats you wrong
Just come with me and I'll take you home
No need to pack a bag
Who put your life in the danger zone?
You running dropping like a rolling stone
No need to pack a bag
The old man dies and then a baby's born
Just come with me and I'll take you home
Shan, shan shan shan-gri la
