Yeah, what’s high?
Ha, and what’s low?
Well if you’re looking for me I’m probably in Metropolis
I do this for the love so this is non-profit shit
I’m bored walking so you call this monopoly
Obviously, my approach to music ain’t moderate
As my mer-ka-ba spins
I am the anomaly
I love all the haters cause the haters is what got me here
Strangers "Hey Bobby" me,
groupies try to body me
But I’m a different planet so excuse my astrology
But there are no apologies for dropping all these prophecies
Breaking over barriers, these juggernauts ain’t stopping me
Balance ain’t symmetrical, I guess I’m just geometry
Guess I’m just atomically built the way that I bomb on the beat
Bomb on the beat
you stride on a beat
We slide on our feet, we tightrope
I don’t need no optometry, I’ll do this in a blindfold
Honestly we live the type of life people would die for
So we keep on tipping every second that we tightrope
Baby baby baby
Whether you high or low
Baby whether you high or low
You got to tip on the tightrope
Now let me see you do the tightrope
And I'm still dreamin on it
Greetings, welcome to the meeting of the minds
They be thinking all the time of defeating all the blind
Following, swallowing, drinking of the time
Honored traditions of keeping in a line
I prefer to figure eight and then Mandelbrot
Rock all night 'til the candles on my mantle stop
Televised revolutionaries on the Chapel top
Shouting, down at Babylonian accounting
Medieval mathematics leave us average amounting
But I surpass that, I dropped out of they math class
I am, cause I thought now my tightrope like a sidewalk
Blat!
Ta-ta talking about me I stay floated like a feather
Jump on the elevator baby we on the next level
Album just dropped and I've been on couple covers
Black and white tux, ain't no need for no other colors
Ta ta talking about, why don't she change her clothes?
Well they ain't seem to mind the last three times I posed in Vogue
Some people get high and then some people get low
Well I'm gon keep it in the middle so my people can know
I can pose, I balance all like I'm Dominique Dawes
