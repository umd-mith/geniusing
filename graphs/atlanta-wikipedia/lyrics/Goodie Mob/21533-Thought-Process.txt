Let me get a chop at this lumber,
niggas from down
Underground they hangin' around the
A-Town
Lookin' for a come up, workin' from 9 to 5
Just to get some change so T-Mo can stay alive
That when I do, nobody from my crew will I forget
And if I start to get large and come up on some change
I won't change, everybody know they down
It's not the same, everyday life can be different
Each and every day as I comb my city streets
Sometimes I wish I never had been a part of this mess
Cause the system got us fucked up
It put us to the test, women and men, if you black you in
this bullshit
Frustrated, irritated, sometimes I don't
Know myself I be too numb
To feel something sometimes so I dig deep
Get in the Cherokee
Let my mind fly free into the wilderness
So I can get this shit off my mind
That's why I be smokin' that dank sometimes
It keep me from snappin', keeps me calm
Keeps my mind open
Sometimes I come home too high to pray
But I get on my bed, lay on my back
And meditate, anyway
cell therapy
I live for today, motherfuck another hour, it might be sour
Never know my day so I'm prayin' in the shower
Look up and thank the Lord for forgiveness, a witness to bad
I'm lookin' for good in the Southwest, God bless my neighborhood
It's people killin' in the street to eat
Survivin’ the day is the only goal that I set
My head felt swoll, messed up, couldn't see past my mouth
“What route did you take man?” Got me by the loops of my pants
Got me on the curb lettin' the traffic pass me by
Lookin' for the mutant to be buckin' the law, naw man Gipp
Showed him my shit, closed my mouth then I dip
See to me a G is a person who understands the plan
Can't make no moves when you in the hands of the man
They got some new suites down Peachtree
Left wing for the Feds, right wing for the hardheads
Makin' more deals than Buddy Fowlkes made with Hartsfield
Somebody don't want my face in this place for ‘96, shit's slick
Car be clean lookin' fresh, dog be scratchin' at my chest
Under the order of who? Guess who, ain't none iller
Than Miller, wanna 1-2 your ass
No more life what you gave is the past, cause ain't no future
Wanna “Miller camp” your case, disgrace your face
Make it seem to be safe, ain't no place to run
Sometimes I don't even know how I'm gon' eat
'Bout twenty dollars away from being on the street
Shit, you might see a nigga on TV
But hell it's almost like I'm rappin' for free, that little money be gone
It would be nice to have more but I kinda like bein' poor
At least I know what my friends here for
I wanna lie to you sometimes, but I can't
I wanna tell you that it's all good, but it ain't
It's niggas hurtin' and uncertain about
If they gon' make it or not, that's why we got nigga's killing
Feelin' like they comin' up off a little dope they sold
Now as an Outkast I was born
Like elevators but I ain't the one that's pushin' the buttons
I got off at the 13th floor, when they told me that it wasn't one
They said it skipped from 12 to 14
Still smoking, still drinking
No
I'm sittin' on the Lincoln 4 AM thinking
That in reality the world is like a ball full of players
Huh, the only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne
Never thought about hittin' licks or slangin' 'caine
Didn't think I'd be the one to give in to abortion
Label me "murderer" because my ass is scorchin'
Hot from the Glock that sits under my seat
Yeah, it's real fucked up that my folks come to get me
And it's like dat, yeah...and it's like dem!
