You 'bout to make me slam yo' back clean out
But I luv her till death do us part
Though she divorced my pop the hard way
Ma ol' burd... puttin a real buzz in my ear, makin sho' it marinate
And not go out the other ear
God is good, God is kind mimmicin' her taught me how to say mine ...
Grace improvised wit bakin' soda when it wasn't no toothpaste
my ol' burd cried tears of joy
When she heard I wasn't gon' serve time for possession
Of the "sawed off" runnin' out of spurs
When I came home blowed and couldn't find the key hole, guess who
Unlocked the doors,
I better eat before you bug me to death
Shut-up you old ungrateful ass nigga, she trying to help yo' ass...
Slid down my esophagus wit ease, even though she have this skin disease
That won't allow me to gain weight
Guess who tuck me in before I started drivin this Benz
Again & again, told me not to and when I did...
Guess who beat the dog shit outta me kid
My Moma didn't play, shiiit, I had to pick the switches...
My Moma, destination unknown, went out on her own
She was barely even grown and became my Moma
I never knew my dad, so even when the times got bad
I was glad cause I had my Moma
For so long she had to be strong
I know at certain times she was wrong
But she still my Moma, it still amazes me
The Lord had to help her raise me judging from the way I used to be
Thank you for caring, thank you for sharing yo' luv
I guess that was yo' way of preparing
Yo' son to be the one and not the two
Who was tha first to hold you in some arms
Tha first to change your diaper when your stomach wasn't calm
I wonder now she know when I was lying, when I was telling the truth
With the proof she would explain how I've been skipping school
putting wholes on my back with the same belt
Around my waist that held my panst up
Southern Bell
I swear she knew when it was real or when it was fake like Clampetts
With dreads
Who that hell got my bond
Standing in front of that two-inch glass
A woman ready to hand the cash over for her son...
My Mama!!
Sometimes we get it on, I know at times I'm wrong
