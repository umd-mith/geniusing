Fuck nigga, come and talk it out, fuck nigga, we ain't talkin' it out

I bought my bitch a Birkin Bag so she could hold my fuckin strap
That bitch be heavy in my pants and I don't even like to sag
I’m going hard, I'm going hard
Sniffing out the fucking plate
My momma tried to make me dinner but I already ate
These bitches lying, I seen the molly in her eyes
Plus I made the play

I can’t eat no breakfast
Fall asleep in intersections
Stoner, Smith and Wesson
I hope he’s a pedestrian
Man man
lay low in the dip
When you see him let it rip
When you hit him, boy, lets dip
Amalfi Coast, let’s take a trip
Ima call me a singer
Ima make her pack her bags
Imma send her ass there
But I ain’t gonnna send her ass back
