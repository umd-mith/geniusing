[Intro: OG Maco]
God damn, boy, that nigga Mac didn't never call, bruh
But I'm seeing that nigga everywhere, bruh

Fuck that nigga, dog, OGG, fuck is a OGG? OGG, OGG, aye, bruh
I mean, you don't think that nigga really getting no money, right?
I mean, he ain't really fucking hoes, right? Well, damn

[Hook: OG Maco]
Bitch, you guessed it
Hwah, you was right
Bitch, you guessed it
Grah-grah, fuck nigga on sight
Bitch, you guessed it
Still in that place and I'm flexin'
Hwah, bitch, you guessed it
I'm still with my niggas, come and test us, OGG

[Verse 1: OG Maco]
Bitch you guessed it, walkin' around with extra in my pockets
Bitch, you next to us, why the fuck are you next to us?
Bitch, you should come test us
I seen what you rockin' and bitch you can't dress with us
Seen what yo bitch looked like
And nigga I wasn't impressed or nothin'
Fuck nigga, come and talk it out, fuck nigga, we ain't talkin' it out
What the fuck we finna talk about
All we know is that Mula, Benji's, Franklin's and that Guala

Bunch of them bitches all in they whip, lickin' on titties
Runnin' my check up, I think I'm with Nike, I'm sprinting
Sheesh, y'all couldn't hear me

[Hook: OG Maco]
Bitch, you guessed it
You was motherfucking right
Bitch, you guessed it, hwah
Still with my niggas and we flexin
Hwah, bitch, you guessed it, yeah
If you are broke than you cannot stand next to me
Shawty I'm with got her legs in the air for me
And my car mellow like Anthony
Too many rings, too many chains
Too many racks
and some gas on me
Southside with a F ho
And the F stands for 40 thousand, that's what I charge for a walkthrough, uh
Met a girl named Summer in the wintertime, love when she fall through
Had that bitch sprung
took her to the mall to do a ball through
And these true confessions,
I’m making the extras and your pockets anorexic
Text her and said send me pictures naked
She said "Is this 2 Chainz?"
[Outro: OG Maco]
Bitch, you guessed it, hwah
You was right
Still with my niggas and we flexin'
Hwah, bitch, you guessed it
