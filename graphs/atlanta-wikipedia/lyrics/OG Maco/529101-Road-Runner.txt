I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
And my niggas get that money, mansion flexing, opera stunting
When I wake up in the morning I see zeros on my line
When I hop on asphalt I can’t never waste my time
75 to 85, yeah I’m known to take them trips
Turn a dollar to two fifty, yeah I’m known to make them flips
Wear my sponsors in my patches, I’m like NASCAR driving laps
If you ask me where I’m at, I say nigga ask the map
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
And my niggas get that money, mansion flexing, opera stunting
I been road running so my tires gone
I been smoking gas, I got one lung
Your money jog in place so you can’t see my face
If I find out that they zero then I got to take em with me
We don’t talk nothing but money like it’s Franklins in our mouth
Hear you try to take my sack, put that five seven on your scalp
Live life, that’s my family, OGG the fucking gang
Swear I spend so much on gas, should’ve bought a fucking range
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
I been road running, Monday to Sunday, all I know is hundreds
And my niggas get that money, mansion flexing, opera stunting
