I was just rappin' on the floor
Do you understand
Cardo beats on Live Life last year was second-hand
Promised all my family we'd live forever through this pen & hand
Touchscreen, Mac Book, whatever I jot these scriptures in
People tend to think being aggressive is the realest route
Never been a pussy
Don't be foolish, watch the situation
That's just provocation
Tomorrow I can take a flight where ever
Random destination!
My parents caught that new wire
All this from listenin' to them lectures
Sittin' in the kitchen
Mama used to cry cause she didn't know if I would go to prison
Man, they would have gave a youngin' life
Lost me in the system
Man I couldn't have gave this to the world without some good decisions
Everyday I miss [?] thru me they still livin'
Broke or rich we still gettin' it
[Chorus]
Things change when it's diamonds on your wrist
Niggas switch when they pockets go to shit
Swear I'ma keep it trill broke or rich
Swear we gon' keep it trill broke or rich
