12, 12
I just found 12 bricks
Sheesh, damn
Looking on the side
Of the road
There they go
12 bricks
Finna make 'em flip
Gotta make 'em count
Oh my god oh my god, what the fuck I'ma do with that?
12 bricks,
is 12 after me?
Can't let 'em catch me
Can't be another number
Can't get another fumble
Some fuck nigga just fumbled
12 bricks, damn
Trapping trapping
Take 'em to the trap, gotta get it
Came in plastic wrap, gotta split it
12 bricks
In one lick
On the side of roads
12 bricks
We just wrapping, fool
In one lick, 12 bricks
Sheesh
Dammit, what we got here?
Set up shop here
They took a loss
Made myself a boss
(Had to go and get it)
Had to run it up
Had the double cup, it's Hi-Tech in it
12 bricks, they will make you rich, they will make you wealthy You can get it but you gotta keep it stealthy if they find out
Shooters outside of your house
Over 12 bricks
In one lick, 12 bricks
Found 'em on the road
Wrap 'em and they go
12 bricks
And 12 bricks
In one lick
Damn, I had to go
12 sitting behind me
Lights keep on flashing
Got that 30 on me, I might blast it
Oh no, oh no
I'm thinkin' crazy cause I got a moment
One in fender
One in side door, two in side door, one inside the passenger
Two inside the trunk
Did you add it up?
I didn't add it up
Throwing 'em out of the window, I can't throw fast enough
And it's 12 bricks
For one lick
Found them on the road
Had to make 'em go
12 bricks
