(Hook: Jarren Benton)
Gimmie the loot x9
Loot, loot, loot, loot...
Que pasa amigo (que pasa amigo)
I'm back in it bitch
If the head game is right and that pussy feel good
Throw a rack at that bitch
Walked in the club with a strap in that bitch
Niggas they shoot like Iraq in that bitch
I peel off in that thunderbird up in Johannesburg
On a giraffe with this African Bitch
Came from the bottom, my grandmammas house
I'm funeral fresh, get the cameras out
99 bottles of beer on the floor
We went wildin' out, ho, just like animal house
Eatin up rappers the cannibals out
Bust off in your bitch while she layn on your couch
I get head in the whip while she driving that bitch
She carressin my dick and my hands in her blouse
You think they your homies, they snakes in the end
My home boy just died mutha fuck a new friend
One day you here and the next day you gone
We still mourning my nigga so fuck yo new Benz
I'm drinking again trying to mask all the pain
My high coming down i'ma crash, go insane
Party for now
Get the money my nigga
Cuz one day they might come and bash in your brains
We up in this bitch
Just got paid
Got this drank in my cup
Nigga just got straight
We been on it all night
I don't know bout you
I'm on that B.I.G shit
Bitch better have my loot..
Eastside nigga till the day I'm in a pinebox
This marijuana make a motherfuckers (mindstop)
Eyes redder than the cyclopes
Might throw a bitch ass nigga out a sky box
3 stripes on my high tops
Becky my god, I bet you won't lick a pussy while I watch
So high it’s like I'm sitting over Jupiter
Get this money they gone think I worship Lucifer
Being broke was never cool to us
Your favorite rappers just a fairy tale
Niggas mad cause I knew his girlfriend very well
She let me fuck her on the Ferris wheel
Hit South Beach and got head while I parasail
Vodka got the room spinning like a carousel
I'm harder than a bitch that’s trying to parallel
You can find me in the ATL
Might tear this fucking club up like an ACL
