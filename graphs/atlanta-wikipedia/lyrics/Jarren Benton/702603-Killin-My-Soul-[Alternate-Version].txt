[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I was conceived in Dracula's lair
I'm cracking a hater upside his fucking head with the back of a chair
His feet leaps back in the air
I rip the fur off the back of a bear
The blade's precise I could chop off a patch of his hair
Bitch I am a god, riding on the fucking handle bars
Black BMX, AR15 tear you and your man apart
Go out like Tony Montana, they poppin' them hammers, I fall off the banister
Gargantuan, keep your favourite rappers body parts in a canister
Fuck anybody that doubted me, ever looked down on me
Where the fuck where you? Now you're so proud of me
I've been on a grind, bitch I don't know how to sleep
My crew sick to a crucifix
Smoking kush through a hookah stick
Bite the bullet when the ruger spit
Fuck rap, bitch I'm through with it
Niggas know when I was born to ball
Bitch I’m shining like a marmoreal
Light a stick of dynamite "tick, tick" bang and die right in front of ya'll
I'm done with living
Satan I'll be there in a minute
How the fuck you boxing with god bitch when your arms are missing
No religion but my mom's a christian
I had her tripping when she found my porn subscription
I'm on some different shit
And expensive whips with a different bitch
I rip your fucking lungs out with a plumber's wrench
I don't know a nigga living in his right mind that could probably stop me
Nigga shook like a young bitch in a room, fucking Bill Cosby
Mach five, nigga high speed, in his face watch his eyes bleed
Full the plug from the life support and the IV's, nigga try me
Came from the dirt, thank god all the pain it was worth
Thinking my name was cursed, I couldn't get on, I felt so ashamed and hurt
I eat up everything until the fucking reaper gets me
We in this bitch but I still feel depressed and empty
[Hook: Hopsin]
The game's got me in a venomous zone
It's killing my hope, I don't even feel it no mo'
Sometimes I say fuck this shit but I ain't willing to go
Stealing my soul, there's reasons I can't leave it alone (fo so)
My legacy I gotta leave it in stone (you know)
If these other niggas did it we getting on (lets go)
These weak niggas straight up killing my soul
That's why I don't even feel it no mo'
I ain't vibing to it
I feel like I may never wake up every time that I go to sleep
I feel like there’s so many rap niggas you'd probably never notice me
I don't understand how you don't compete
I don't understand how you don't critique
Industry bar been set so low, we accept so-so and rejects unique
Fuck it I'm free
Some of you never believed in my vision and doubted my dream
I can remember the intricate feeling, all the self-doubt that I had as a teen
[Hook: Hopsin]
The game's got me in a venomous zone
It's killing my hope, I don't even feel it no mo'
Sometimes I say fuck this shit but I ain't willing to go
Stealing my soul, there's reasons I can't leave it alone (fo so)
My legacy I gotta leave it in stone (you know)
If these other niggas did it we getting on (lets go)
These weak niggas straight up killing my soul
That's why I don't even feel it no mo'
I ain't vibing to it

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
As of lately my fire's been lower
Dizzy Wright said I might
Need to put a light to some weed to get my mind to tremble
But that ain't me so I'm digging real deep to write this shit
Yo I'm at five percent
I hope my career does not die in limbo
I wake up just praying my fuse is lit
Cause I don't get hyped like I used to get
Back when I would hop in the booth and spit
I'm too immune to this
Stuck in my thoughts, am I a lunatic? (fuck)
Fuck this music shit, what is Hopsin? I don't know who it is
I do give bitches spontaneous hunger
And when I do there's a cloud of raining and thunder
That you'd hate to get under
And when that happens ain't no place to get comfort
I'm labeled a monster, you may be a goner
I put listeners in the craziest slumber
A note to peasants, my vocal presence
Is so perfect that fans get so obsessive
And cry to my shit but don't confess it
When I'm in my zone you feel that power and passion
My godly words can speak louder than action
And don't forget it nigga

[Hook: Hopsin]
The game's got me in a venomous zone

My legacy I gotta leave it in stone (you know)
