Don’t fuck with that boy, don’t play with that boy, he’s out of his mind
24 hours 7 days of the week been out of my grind
OJ, ride around the hood like OJ
Sippin on gin and OJ
Blow a whole O of that
OJ
On the white girl like OJ
All my nigga locked up like OJ
Killin’ everything like OJ
My clique sick, bitch, we ain't okay
[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Guess who’s peepin’ on your window
With an automatic laser gun aimin’ at your temple
Word to my kin folk
Your ho blow a nigga like a fucked up game from an oldschool Nintendo
Bitch, I been sick since an embryo
yup ho I finna’ blow
How the hell these body parts end up in this envelope
I had a couple meetings with Def Jam and Interscope
My hopes got shot down I thought that I was in the do'
Back to reality, now I’m on top like nigga fuck gravity
You mad at me I fill a gym sock up with batteries
I beat ‘em in the fuckin’ head, that’s a fatality
Fuck you and a random whore by the name of Natalie
You niggas couldn’t shake me, move me or rattle me
Baby, I’m an animal, you don’t wanna battle me
I can dance with the devil inside of a ball room
Nigga, fuck all you, this is Funk Volume,
pop a Valium
In a bathroom with a crack whore, and write about it on my brand new album
Niggas on powder, I ain’t talkin’ Talcum
Waitin’ by the window with a gun like Malcolm
X, money, cars, whores, sex, blades, knives, pumps, techs
4 phones
two candy cribs, Mariah Carey
Niggas ain’t hard enough to sell hard
They too soft to sell soft
Y’all pop the Molly, I sell the Molly, don’t fuck with Pill like Rick Ross
Nigga talk shit bet he end up dead
When I strapped leave a nigga so wholey
We’ll crash your crib and we’ll snatch your kids
Me and Jarren Benton so Kony
Killin’ everything like OJ
Dick in the mouth like Colgate
PBR baby, fuck Rosay
Who the fuck scared of you
I bury you
Cheers to a New Year
Chuck a whole can, fuck two beers
If it ain’t about bread, it ain’t concern us
I’m a fucker, get a fireproof suit cause that burn up
