P-P-P-PBR, zip and a double cup (PBR and Reefer)
P-P-P-PBR, zip and a double cup (PBR and Reefer)
P-P-P-PBR, zip and a double cup (PBR and Reefer)
P-P-P-PBR, zip and a double cup (PBR and Reefer)
This that loud, this that loud
This that strong, this that strong
This that drink, this that drink
That I sip on, that I sip on
This that loud, this that loud
This that strong, this that strong (PBR and Reefer)
This that drink, this that drink
That I sip on, that I sip on (PBR and Reefer)
PBR, zip and a double cup
all my bitches double dutch
We don't really cuddle much, y'all niggas gay
Sweet as Reese's peanut butter cup
Back up in this bitch with a six pack
Tell them sucka ass niggas Jarren said get back
Chillin' with yo girlfriend, on Saturday we kick back
Bitch gon' take a bath cause that's the only way I eat her
We on it all night
Out of weed and brew, that's the shit I don't like
My ho got a side ho, we get along tight
my niggas all white
Just got back from Cali, bitch it's been a long flight
Need a PBR and weed, finna set it off right
Bumping southernplayalistic through the speaker
Ride through the A, and I'm looking for a skeezer
Suck a nigga dick, shawty do it for the leisure
Pound while I'm here, before a nigga leave her
Blowin' on that strong that will make you have a seizure
Damn I had too many PBRs, so I pull off of the road
Damn I think I'm bout to throw up on my T-Shirt
Pop the pussy, I'm sweatin' (woo)
She pop the pussy, I'm sweatin' (woo)
Tell them hatin' niggas don't fuck around
Cause my crew just strapped with them weapons
Party like a redneck, loud pack
Worry sack, can't walk straight, got me spinning like a pirouette
I'm high as the tip of a pyramid
Bitch don't kill my vibe, lock her out, shut the fuck up I ain't hearing it
Flexin' on these hoes, I'm flexin' on these hoes
Pour one more, burn one more
I'm so trippy off of this dope (Trippy)
I fuck up yo summertime, the summer's mine, you ain't know
Made a song for all you scumbags who love to drink and smoke
