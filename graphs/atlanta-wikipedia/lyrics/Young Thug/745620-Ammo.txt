Got my broadie London in this mothafucker man
I’m tell ya this beat, hard, this one hard as fuck, listen bro
And I got old hunnids, they wrinkled like a Shar Pei
And them boys from Atlanta, tote them K's yeah
And them boys from Atlanta got bananas like these monkey nigga
I’m doing numbers
I got bands in the bando
All my diamonds come in yellow like a Funion
Sticky fingers, no porcupine
