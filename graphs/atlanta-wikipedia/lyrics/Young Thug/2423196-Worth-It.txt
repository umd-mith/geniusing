Got my bae with me, you know what I'm sayin'?
If she don’t get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (I'm so happy)
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that
I know she livin' for a nigga, dyin' for a nigga
I whip that pussy with no ballers jumpin' out, lil nigga
That pussy look just like a cut, a soakin' cut, lil nigga
Yeah, I'm a freak, you know I'm pullin' up to lush, lil nigga
I'd never snooze to lose, I would never snooze to lose on you
Yeah, I'ma give you a couple bands,
want some more boobs on you
Hey, I'ma sit back and pay attention like school on you
Yeah, I'ma shoot inside that pussy like a wholly on you
Goddamn, I'm sorry b, I know you'd accepted my apology
I know that ass fat, apple bottom please
I need a deep throat baby, swallow me
I love it when you're around baby, follow me
I only eat green like koala leaf
We shoot with big guns like a Call of D
Can't shoot with a pistol, need a K
let
I can see it on her face that she gettin' wet
When she don’t get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth
No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth
Yeah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp (hey)
Damn, I broke her heart, now my heart hurt
I don't know why but I done cut down on that syrup
At least I got that lil bitch ballin', she don't gotta work
Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she having purses
No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty
She get on top and she ride it, kentucky derby
You should see I count that money like a nerdy
I'ma ball some with my dawgs but they ain't curvy
Her whole body same color, I call it perfect
Since she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (yeah)
Looked up baby and say goodbye (Bobby Bruh)
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth
No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth
Yeah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp
