[Intro]
Did you pray today?
Did you pray today?
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
Did you pray today?
I could put you down on the gangster shit
I could put you down with some gangster shit
Did you pray today?
Her sex is amazin'
She like penetratin'
I'll leave that pussy achin'
Thugger!
I was bangin', servin' rocks inside my classes
Big pimpin', you can send or just fax it
I was fresh, every day like it was my last
These politics, they're tryna lock me out and latch it
These politics, they're tryna block me, but I'm savage
For every bitch that tried to diss me, I'm not average
I told my mom I want some green, ain't talkin' cabbage
These bitches backstabbin' and these niggas done turned to addicts
They ridin' 'round geeked up out their mind
Soon as they come down, ain't got a fuckin' dime
Where that nigga that raised you? That's a whole other story
Her nigga's diamonds like glaciers, seven rings on me like Horry
I flood my wifey with them VVs and that CC
I swear to God I've been so fresh ever since little league
My old lady know all these girls are tryna steal me
Steal, yeah
Check out my diamonds, I'ma shine until they feel me
They put them teeth inside my mouth and then she healed me
All these pussy niggas really small, little league
Yeah she put that pussy on my log
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
I could put you down on some gangster shit
I could have you ridin' round with gangsters, shit
I can talk to Ralo, he a gangsta nigga
Runnin' circles, on these niggas
Drinkin' color purple, on these niggas
Ayyy, I'ma take off runnin', on these bitches
When hungry, I fill up my tummy, with these riches
When I'm servin' you, homie, when I'm servin' you
Gotta keep the tool on me, gotta keep the tool
Her booty lookin' plummy, plummy
These lil' niggas lookin' bummy, bummy
OG Kush, it's smellin' like a junkie, junkie
These fuck niggas, they done bought my drugs
They'll have you lookin' like a man in debt
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
I could put you down on some gangster shit
I could have you ridin' round with gangsters, shit
I could talk to Claire, she's a gangsta bitch
I can talk to Ralo, he a gangsta nigga
