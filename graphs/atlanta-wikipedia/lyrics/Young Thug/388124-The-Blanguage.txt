[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I fucked her then washed off my dick
With the curtains inside of the Phantom
If he standing next to Young Thugger
I train them to kill for the camera
You do not act grown when around
You lil’ baby, you need you a pamper
I'm one slimy motherfucker,
the devil ride my back like camels
I’m feelin’ like Malcom in the Middle
These bitches, they surround me, they can't miss him
I’m slimey man I’ll wipe a nigga nose
The next time won't be a roll of tissue
A young nigga came a long way
From standin’ on the corner with them pistols
I bought her lot of MissMe jeans but I will never ever miss her
I’m chillin’ at the studio
These bitches wanna fuck on the banana boat
I’m on the outskirt, chasin’ out the green
Smokin’ orange kush feelin’ like a cantaloupe
I fell in love with Hannah Montana
All of her niggas dance at the cameras
I fucked her cause I slimed at her, brother
Then I pulled off, and left the bitch with the nana
The devil done caught my soul
The devil done caught my soul
The devil done caught my soul
The devil done caught my soul
Soul, soul, soul done caught my soul
Ran through my money, my diamonds come wet like a fisherman
I catch the lil bitch and I take her to shop up at Wish and shit!
I’m ballin, I never foul out start with the figure eight
You pussy, you know you a cat
I see your whiskers you might Tigger it
Room at the Intercontinental, room at the intercontinental
Metro, Rollie icey it ain't December
I wanna see all the bitches in the front
With her friends dancing with the pole inside the middle
Is it a parade? Kill a nigga
Babysitter, drink vanilla,
we are realer, aye
Fuck your mama, fuck your sister, fuckin' kill her, aye
RO'5,
caterpillar,
rollin’ with em, aye
Found my rhythm, now that’s his ass. Run and kick him, aye
I say the truth because she's the truth
Nigga creepin in that coupe, doesn’t fit the roof
Talkin shit, might drop, people listen to it
I’m bangin’ blood, I could never flue it
I fucked her then washed off my dick with the curtains inside of the Phantom
If he standing next to Young Thugger, I train them to kill for the camera
I’m feelin’ like Malcom in the Middle
These bitches, they surround me, they can't miss him
A young nigga came a long way from standin’ on the corner with them pistols
I’m chillin’ at the studio these bitches wanna fuck on the banana boat
I’m on the outskirt, chasin’ out the green smokin’ orange kush feelin’ like a cantaloupe
Then I pulled off another bitch with the nana

[Interlude: Young Thug]

Metro Boomin want some more
Metro Boomin want some more
Metro Boomin want some more
Metro Boomin want some more
Metro Boomin want some more,  nigga

[Outro: Young Thug]
Metro, Rollie icey it ain't December
I wanna see all the bitches in the front
With her friends Dancing with the pole inside the middle
Is it a parade? Kill a nigga (3x)
