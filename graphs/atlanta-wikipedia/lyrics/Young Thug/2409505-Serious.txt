Isaac X Tugga
Young Thug
Future ain't hazy
I'ma treat a bitch just like a bitch
I'ma treat a snitch just like a snitch (fuck 'em)
Dressin', I get flyer than a witch
I don't wanna wrestle like a bitch
Black Portland, this is Blatlanta, bitch
I can't remember that hoe, I'm too rich
And I'm so serious
So serious
So serious
So serious
So serious
I fuck hoes all over the world
I make it beauty like CoverGirl
YSL 'til I'm dead and pale
Nah, for real, for real
I'ma fuck long just like a muh'fucka
Have her head pointed to the ceilin' like a muh'fucka
Suck like candy, I'm a fiend like a muh'fucka
Give her big dick on a candy stick
Suck my whole clique and get rich like a muh'fucka
Muh'fucka, yes I'm rich like a muh'fucka
I'ma turn up my whole clique, watch it, muh'fucka
I know that she's a gnat like a muh'fucka
I told that lil' baby this the pedigree
Now she don't get no sleep like a muh'fucka
I make 'em fuck the streets and bring it to me
I'm a P.I.M.P., yep, muh'fucka
I'm a bad mothafucka
Green and red mothafuckin' flag, modyfucka
I dress like a prince, not a fag, modyfucka
Leave a nigga dead, fuck a sad modyfucka
Fuck her, pay, get that shit out my face
Take over these streets like a parade
And drinkin' gin and juice, boolin' in these shades
No I'm not gay
when I hit it though they rate me
I'ma treat a bitch just like a bitch
I'ma treat a snitch just like a snitch
Dressin', I get flyer than a witch
Black Portland, this is Blatlanta, bitch
And I'm so serious
So serious
So serious
So serious
So serious
I fuck hoes all over the world
I make it beauty like CoverGirl
YSL 'til I'm dead and pale
Nah, for real, for real
Bitch I got water like a seal
Bitch I'll be back like an appeal
I don't know the time, but I got five watches
Only thing a nigga know about that time is
It don't stop and it's timeless
Only thing I know is fuck around with Keyshia
Rich shit all in a nigga blood
Diamonds movin' like a skater, baby
High, super high like Space Invaders, baby
I'll go around like an equator, baby
I am on top like a toupee, lil' baby
You drag me just like a trailer, baby
I push down and go like an eraser, baby
I'ma treat a bitch just like a bitch
I'ma treat a snitch just like a snitch, fuck 'em
Dressin', I get flyer than a witch
Black Portland, this is Blatlanta, bitch
And I'm so serious
So serious
So serious
So serious
So serious
I fuck hoes all over the world
I make it beauty like CoverGirl
YSL 'til I'm dead, and pale
Nah, for real, for real
