[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I might pop a perc and just go crazy
Fucking on your bitch like I want babies
Diamonds hit like Rocky bitch I'm famous
Walking with a hundred bitch I made it
Leaning and tripping on two pills
Sippin' on pints of the double seal
They told me to stop but I'm sippin' still
Yo hoe putting up but she know the drill
Momma' said be patient
I had no Mercedes
I was on the block I trapped that rock, like back in the 80s
Just know that I pour up a whole pint
Like fuck it I'm back on the dirty Sprite
I'm catching the plays like Jerry Rice
My young niggas killing might take your life
My teachers said I couldn't do right
Pull up in Porsche and it's all white
I'm all in her head like fucking lice
Play with the money you pay the price

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it
How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it
I need my money on time, each and every dime
I just want a bag with the cash in it
Just need a bitch that can dab with me
Adderall

How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it
I need my money on time, each and every dime
I just want a bag with the cash in it
Just need a bitch that can dab with me

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
I might pop a xan and just go lazy
But I got them workers so they pay me
I got all these bitches like I'm pimpin'
And your baby momma' now she drippin'
Walking around with a lot of cash
Rari' I ride with a paper tag
Momma' she said that I'm living fast
I need to slow down but I do the dash
Put my wrist in it when I'm whippin' up
I got your bitch she gon' cook it up
Fuckin her all on the furniture
She don't speak no English a foreigner
Bitch quit playing I'm dangerous
I got the molly and Katie
I'm fuckin her she call me baby
Ain't go for it, you better pay me
Dressed in Givenchy I'm dabbing
Bricks disappearing no magic
You talking my money it's savage
A whole lotta' racks cause I gotta have it

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it
How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it
I need my money on time, each and every dime
I just want a bag with the cash in it
Just need a bitch that can dab with me
