Taught 'em how to whip it, broke my wrist, I bought a coupe
Run up in that pussy, dabbin' in your bitch like "Woo!"
Jumpman, Jumpman, I been had that traphouse jumpin'
I ain't had no paper, I came up from nothin'
Bitches wanna fuck me cause I pull up stuntin'
Meet my plug in Paris, first time out the country
Taught 'em how to whip it, broke my wrist, I bought a coupe
Run up in that pussy, dabbin' in your bitch like "Woo!"
Bought that hoe a burger when she got up off her knees
They callin' me the janitor, I got a bunch of keys
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, that boy up to somethin'
Actavis in every cup, I'm sippin' muddy
Jumpman dunkin' in the bitch like Kylie Jenner
Donald Trumpin', I've been runnin' with the money
Feelin' just like Kanye, you can't tell me nothin'
Hunnid came through Ace of Spaces on a Sunday
Heard these bitches don't love you 'less you got some money
I got plenty chickens,
I don't want no champagne, all I drink is lean
