If you know like a know then you know that I know that niggas be hating
I can't wait 'til the day I call up moms and tell mama, I made it
I can't wait 'til the day I call up all of the people that hated
I fucked that bitch then I passed her to bro cause I know that you hate it
Can't wait 'til I make it
Fuck waiting, shit I'm finna take it
Why do these niggas be hating, these niggas be hating, these niggas be hating
I don't give a fuck about the politics, don't give a fuck about debating
Me and my brother be balling like Eli and motherfucking Peyton
All of these diamonds on Yachty, these diamonds on me, all these diamonds be skating
I watch my brother jump out the front door, he whip that pot with that bacon
Aye aye, and my bitch ass fat, I told that bitch never to stop eating bacon
How many niggas you know count that shit up like lil boat?
How many niggas you know get that shit straight off the boat?
All of my niggas be shooting, they bust that shit straight at your throat
And they think that everything funny, I see why all these niggas jokes
Versace covers
I fuck with that bitch with no rubber, don't give a fuck about another
I promise I do not love her, fuck her then dump her, I do not cuff her, no
