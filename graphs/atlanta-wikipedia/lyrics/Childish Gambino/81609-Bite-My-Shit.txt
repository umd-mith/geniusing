Ok, put your lightsaber hoodie up
Why's everybody tryin' to bite my shit
Everybody tryin' to bite my shit
They tryin' to bite shit
If you don't like it, you can suck my dick, nigga
I like the ass in the way
I got jeans like Billie like Holiday
This shit fade like Hardaway
Fuck around with niggas get clocked like a cartier
Bitch, close your mouth
Nigga, I'm so clean, but I'm from the South
Nigga, I eat cats, my name is ALF
Girls don't got drugs but they assin' out
And when things go down like the NASDAQ
Shit, I still run it like a lab rat
I don't got sponsors
So check for Nicktoons because Aahhh! Real Monsters
I'm a real monster, I got a home for these creatures like Foster
That's another cartoon, mama
You know I spit silly shit like a sick llama
You know these girls crave drama
I ain't the one, I'm a drop Ralph Fiennes on you
I'm at the beach in a phantom
I'm full house cause my DJ Tanner
Shine bright, got money, Green Lantern
I pay a dude to hold my shit like pampers
Shine bright like the sun, no Sanford
And my shit go spread like cancer
At my show, yo, my girls ain't dancing
They're too busy saying, "He's so handsome"
