Starter cap bro, gone with the hologram
I'm in a rich folk's home like a ottoman
I got green in my hand like a Heineken
I'm throwback like a Flinstone's Vitamin
I'm fire! All I need is the brimstone
I make noise in the streets like a ringtone
I make movies with my lover like J-Lo
I'm Weird like Al, I'm strange like love
I wear hot pink cause it fit like glove
I'm easy on the eyes; I'm hard on a hater
My hoodie lightsaber, like Darth Vader
I'm always with a chick cause a nigga so sick
Need an Entourage quick so you can hug it out bitch
(I'm so fresh)
I'm so fresh like a Sick Boi oughta be
I'm not tryin that shit, just a part of me
I'm easy, like a Sunday morning
I go to rap battles and I end up yawning
I'm fresh like TexMex in Arizona
Got my gold on forever like my name Ramona
I can't be a loser, the shit don't suit me
A nigga Joe Cool and you niggas just Snoopy!
You can go sue me, try to do outdo me
I look so fresh that I killed George Clooney
I guess you can call me the perfect storm
I'm the reason why your new baby brother was born
A nigga so tore call me Natalie
Cause I love making music but they mad at me
I make money, blow shows like a syndicate
I'mma be who I gotta be, that's the epithet
