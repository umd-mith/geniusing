Fighting hard, fighting strong
Fighting harder and stronger
Fighting hard, fighting strong
Fighting harder and stronger
Ohhhhhhhh
I will fight for you
I will hold you so deep in the light, ohh
Ohhhhhh
I will fight for you
I will hold you into the night
Ohhhh
Waiting for my moment, it's now or never
Heartbroken and hopeless, it's now or never
Down on my life, felt like dyin's better
for ou
Don't come round here tryna find yourself
Belly of the beast,
boolin'
I woke up with a vendetta this mornin'
Rise and shine, demise of my mind and I'm haunted
My pride won't die til I'm dormant
Show me where the war at
It's death threats on my door mat
I'm selfish, I need all that
No accolade escape
See I be sittin' in the grave
'Fore I be sittin' in the cage
Asked Ali what's the price of war
Asked God why momma made me poor
Ask police why they hunt me down
We fight to live and fight for sport
I try to give, they ask for more
I back away, they turn they back
Lifestyle of talented and black
Back on the roads, I must react
This my story
Yeah this is my story
