[Verse 1: Adele]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever
Pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's
Bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep
Me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me
Breathless
I can't help feeling
[Chorus: Adele]
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hands
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hands
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it--
Swag
Come back to me like hipsters to Blogspot
Let me kiss you on your neck and make your heart stop
I'll give your new dude a fat lip: Pharcyde
I wrote another song, I'm not where I belong
My eyes water when I see hers: catalogue
I never thought you were a cheater, that was all
I need to get ahold of my head: jacking off
You ran back to them grody-ass indie dudes
James Perse cardigans, scuffed-up tennis shoes
Wow, girl, that's what you really wanted, huh?
A Michael Cera knockoff, I guess I wasn't white enough
You said I wasn't capable of loving you, I never was
A twenty-something nigga touring the world with hella buzz
I'm saying that my life's swell: cortizone
Fuck Macaulay Culkin, never going home alone
IPhone photos, show 'em just to mock you
Read your Twitter messages, too proud to block you
Spread shit around, "You know that his glasses fake"
That's why I'm dating girls now whose asses ain't
"Damn, Donald, why you gotta be so mean?"
I'm a nice guy, that's why you broke up with me
You probably in the club dancing to this right now
Play it cool, text me when you walk out
