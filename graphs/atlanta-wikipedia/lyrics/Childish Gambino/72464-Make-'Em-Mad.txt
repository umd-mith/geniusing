Childish Gambino you will get in with a wristband he know
People took an hour just to stand outside in line
I knew that you would do it, and I reckon you lookin' fine
These bitches better be mine, I'm horny all the time
Gambino be the one who put a hump up in your spine
Drink a little wine, do a little dance
Now im goin' home, now im in your pants
Forget that, I ain't take the condom off
New swag ever since im bustin' off
I get head like a bottle of Tylenol
You like girls when you know you can buy them all
A fireball, I'm hot as fuck, I bust a nut with tons of sluts
Go ahead shake your thing baby, look hot
Why the girls doin' me? Ho why not?
I mean why not?
Tell her, some bullshit on my whip im 'bout to take it back
When I switch it up I pull up in the newest jag
Any time we in I hit the strip and do it bad
Y'all nigga's hatin' us I know we make 'em mad
It make 'em mad
It make 'em mad
It make 'em mad
When we put on the swag
It make 'em mad when we put on the swag
[Steve G. Lover]
Ay, Childish let me get em'
They ain't in our league, so they can't hang with em'
Strip club, and the squad came with em'
Two girls coming home like they fresh outta prison
Say words if you get it
We only give a damn if a check came with it
I got bitches in the pen who I don't even visit
You came in the carpet
You get a lot of pussy when they make you a star
I was a little broke but it started to change
Drop a couple songs, and that's all of the bang
Cause I ridin' on the track like I'm part of a train
I drink roc' roc' straight fuck the juice
A big bro throw bread like fuck the loot
When you stunt like Stevie, it'll turn off
