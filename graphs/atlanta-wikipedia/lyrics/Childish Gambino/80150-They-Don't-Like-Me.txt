Somebody tell they people what the fuck is up
I'm grindin' like a doozer looking cool as fuck
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I sell the stage
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I'm gettin' paid
Eddy Scissorhands is workin' on my linin'
Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing
Fredward Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin'
Down the Ryan
in a Scion
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance
On the run because I got warrants
but it's cool I got endurance
In school I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings
Could've spent it all on Thursday,
but I saved it for my parents
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald
I'm tired of McDonalds,
want a chick that cook chicano
That can't speak a lick of English, and pronounce my name like Chano
She say something something Spanish
I look back like, "Bitch, I know"
Tonight, I'mma make decisions for life
Take some lucy's boomer's dark liq' and light, some might drive
That's that shit right there that I don't like
There that shit just had to say
Shouts to the niggas that passed away
And shots for the niggas that's here right now
And shots at the niggas that got away
So sad to say, but it's all good
Niggas gon' celebrate, and wait for the day
And wait for the day shit detonate, with Alize
Like live from the Chi', it's Saturday night
Used to have some patience, now it's all gone
Force feed these motherfuckers eatin' foie gras
I'm a say my piece, these other rappers lockjaw
I don't think they like me (I don't think they like me)
I don't think I'm icy, I think I'm aight, B
Niggas wanna fight me? That's unnecessary
I don't quit for shit, that's my legendary
[Outro]
