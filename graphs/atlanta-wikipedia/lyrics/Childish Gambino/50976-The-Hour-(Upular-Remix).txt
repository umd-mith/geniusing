I do not talk, I am just a rapper
It's the kid with the voice
Hipster kids are like "fuckin' NOICE!!"
"How the fuck did he do this shit?!"
"This song's been out for like fifteen minutes"
Yeah I did it
Mr. Incredible, when everybody's special, no one is
So I guess I'm So Much Better
That's my song like girls with tight sweaters, get it?
That one's for the fans,
purell on my hands
This nigga stay dirty like two trash cans
I'm Dope in white hoods not Ku Klux Klan
I'm Dope in black hoods not the Dope Man, That cocaine
You don't even know me like Steve Urkel
That was a prototype, now I'm flexin', like the radio
And I used to be Slim like Shady, though
Now I'm so fat, that's a true fact
Got balls like I grew a new nut sack
Girls go nuts when I drive by
Gotta hide my dick, Lady GaGa
It's a Bug's Life for these other guys
I'm a giant, I don't compromise
Been down with these dudes like a comforter
Only direction to go, then, is Up for me
I do not talk, I'm a rapper
Beat rapist, I attack it
And this rap game? It's a racket
And these fake dudes still tryna crack it
Do Pixar, do your own thing
Then get signed by Disney
It's hard work, but it's easy
In other words, just be me
Love life so bad I would die for it
And I wouldn't trade an eye for an eye for it
Hip Hop's little brother, on top but undercover
With a girl and we see each other
But we don't date, there's a difference
Cause I don't get gifts like Christmas
Bambi is the man of the hour
The decade
The century
The millenium
