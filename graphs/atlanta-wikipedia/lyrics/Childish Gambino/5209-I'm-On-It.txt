[Hook]
Yes I'm On it, I'm So On it(x7)
Oh, Oh, Oh
[Verse 1]
Okay, One for the money, two for the money
I used to write jokes, ain't this shit funny?
Models on me, yes these girls crazy
Gotta take advantage that is what the fans made me
Shine on these niggas, how these niggas stay shady?
And if you don't see me, you are not star gazing
Play my cards right, I may never meet the dealer
And yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer
I gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller
Is it weird going hard when these niggas goin
pillow
Yep, my life is great, I changed my stars
I re-arrange fate when I rap on bars
Cheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me
Chilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy
mean mugging
face is sour like my whiskey
I don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me
Who'd of thought this rapping make sense, no 50?
And if you're doing great like I am, Say it with me
[Hook]
Yes I'm On it, I'm So On it(x6)
Oh, Oh, Oh
Yeah, I used to be broke, no Cash
And them niggas played games,
Road Rash
Walking 'round NYU
Looking for a dollar
Too proud to ask my friends or
my struggling father
So I skate around the city for a couple hours
Dreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours
Now I got some, but I want it all
And I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call
And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol
Cause this shit hurts
call it the uncle curse
But I'm living for the moment, not the long haul
And I refuse to slow down until its last call
Erykah keeps telling me to grow a conscience
And treat women like money, no object
But these hoes are a much different story
Straight laced chicks don't do nothing for me
I'm in a weird place, I got a little money
But money won't buy you time,
If all the time
is running from me
There's so much I wanna do, like write a script or write a book
Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook
And stop having all of these crushes on all of my friends girlfriends
I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends
It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those
I haven't found Mrs. Right, but I'm On it though
Yeah I'm on it though
