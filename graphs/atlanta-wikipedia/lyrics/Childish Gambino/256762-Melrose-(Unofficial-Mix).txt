Remember back when we had just met
I was living life on reasons that i could not get
You probably only talked to me cause I was someone new
But you were interested cause it was someone to get you
I think I notice that I could never forget you
I want you to be happy, a break I'mma let you
And I would wait for ya, perfect tale, Hachi
I know you will be back, honest, no dude that can match me
We are perfect, you bring me up, you can't tell me
You can't see us living a life like Carl Fredricksen and Ellie
By all means if you don't get what that means
I am more then a dude who wants to be up in your jeans
But I love that shit, we do it big
Shit I'mma dog for you, its what I dig
But at the moment if this is not what you need
Let me tell you that our love is what people dream of
I think you're the reason I feel I'm gettin better
We can fuck till we come to conclusions, you're gettin wetter
I think without you who will watch the sequel of The Purge
Im on the verge of saying that I'm all yours its my word
I do not really know how to get it through to you, you're beautiful
Its crazy when we lay it down all the things I do to you
And I feel that too long, I've been feeling too strong
To let emotions go from you
That's really how I feel wit you
The things we can do
The talks we have and how we're so true
Thats how it is, lets make our own movie
We can be ourselves, honestly you're a real beauty
