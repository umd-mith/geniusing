Used to push a skateboard, now I got a Beemer
Pockets steady drowning, haven't heard from FEMA
None of it's from rapping, so I guess this is my hobby
But I'm selling out these venues so these labels tryna sign me
Being broke is so behind me even though I try to keep it real
Like these girls with small tits when niggas cop a feel
Yes I'm on their heels when it comes to spitting syllables
Bitches are a dime a dozen, girls are individuals
"Childish Gambino is the lamest fucker," how you figure?
Whitest dude you ever met but ain't afraid of saying "nigga"
Yes these fucks are talking 'bout their money like I give a fuck
When they know they can't afford like they need a truck
Rolling outta bed to write a screenplay, leave her naked
I need a girl who makes her own cake, Anita Baker
I'm breaking up with girls who don't like my ambition
When their clothes are from my wallet, and their food is in my kitchen
I remember the good times
And I remember the bad
After all the craziness we've been through
From the beginning
I'm moving on
This is goodbye
A promise is a promise, man
My work has taken over me, I am not proud of it
It's hard to keep a normal life when you are more than normal
I write a song and sleep for two hours, a rare disorder
They tell me come to bed while I'll be up just writing stuff
Pussies need the Black Keys, y'all need to tighten up
My luxuries outweigh my problems
catch my shit and be my condom
Ladies holler that's a joke y'all need to lighten up
Yes I stay fly and well read like a cardinal
Fucking girls from TV show's, my DVR is on the pill
Sometimes they use the ring, I am Gollum in this motherfucker
Fresh Prince a nigga, man call me when you know another
Searching for the perfect girl ain't working, I found nothing yet
Kinda wanna settle down, don't think that I'm done fucking yet
So let me write these verses, and stay up late at night
I don't think you can keep up with my life, ight?
