This song was made so you can rave in suburban houses
Or college dorms, any party without a bouncer
So drink your self into oblivion
I'mma be up in the corner trying to mac on this girl named Vivian
I love parties where people don't have to pay
And have to scream loud so you can communicate
Rude girls who are sweeter than Betty Crocker
Will usually loosen up with a bottle of Johnnie Walker
So take totes and quotes from me, charming
I get more ass than toilet seats and mule farmers
Lesson one, always pretend you're listening
So if she tries to tell a quote, try and finish it
This way she'll think it's destined to be
Then she's stripping off clothes and showing anatomy
Bad at me, wants me to call her up again
Even though when I was talking I was thinking about her friend
So you can call me an asshole if you want
I talk shit, so all of my shit comes out the front
[Outro]
