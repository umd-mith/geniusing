See I be riding through my old hood, same old attitude
Chillin with your girlfriend, why she always mad at you
She be like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Only time that she quiet, when my thing is inside her
Don't you know I'm a writer
Yeah, I sleep in her stomach
And I slip her a 50, just to keep her 100
Yeah, my swaggers so dummy
We so stupid, so silly
I watch them girls getting lower than the kick in "A Milli"
Gambino, why you got a gold chain?
Cause girls only gonna see you when you stuntin, man
I'm coming back, swag on Rogaine
Girl lemme see you 2 Chainz old name
So hood, what y'all talking bout
Man, I'm watching Law and Order on my grandma's couch
Eating Lucky Charms for dinner,
loser to a winner
Swag so Clippers,
me and Blake Griffin
Me and Blake Griffin,
why your goals dripping
You ever seen ballas like us po' pimping?
Ha, we getting drunk like a Kennedy
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Grease
Yeah, I got Os like CP3
Don't worry, don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me
I'm only worried when that period's on CPT
When that period's on CPT
