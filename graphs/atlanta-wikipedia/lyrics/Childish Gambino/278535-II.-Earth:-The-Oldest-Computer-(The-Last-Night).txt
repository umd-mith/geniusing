See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day you call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me
That "A" on my chest like adultery
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, nevermind
It was time, number nine, lies
Feline with a deathwish
E-vite didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we were destined
See now I don’t wanna see an era (no), an era (no), an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
(You and me)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Fireworks)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Oh, all the stars)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Super moon)
Maybe it's the last night
All that I have
All I don't have's the future
Take on my soul
All night
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
They godless, denied us
But we don't give a, about the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the truth then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to
the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, never know fear
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress the only thing that will last
3005, the year that we fear, only God will survive
To be alone is alive
See now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
[Outro: Childish Gambino]
She got that body, oh me oh my
Send them pics to my phone,
GPOY
She got that body, oh me oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
GPOY
GPOY
GPOY
GPOY
GPOY
GPOY
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
