I done seen, niggas that was eatin' together fall off the table over bitches
It ain't personal nigga you should be handlin your business
Closed mouths get open the barrel of burners put in them
Closed eyes get led through the darkness
Vision's blurred how about you niggas try to change your fate
You killin' niggas in your hood, you the KKK?
What's the difference between you and them?
Boys in blue and the boys in white
I used to be with them
Boys in blue sellin' poison white to my own folks
Ridin' through my old hood but I'm in that new whip
Same old burner it got a new clip
Everyday, new young nigga dead on the news clip
Every hood, same old niggas don't ever do shit
Before I be a deadbeat father I hang myself, on my mama
I done seen, niggas sell drugs to their own blood
I done seen kids steal drugs from their own parents
Just to start a habit that they would inherit
I done seen, real niggas fall victim to the fame
And my vision gettin clearer everyday
You take a little Biggie and a little Big L
Add an adolescent on the corner with packs to sell
You take a little Em and Andre 3k, and guess what you got
The 2016 2Pac, back and improved
You couldn't walk a step in my shoes I been that dude
Champagne, champagne, champagne, welcome to the Winner's Circle
Welcome to the winners circle
All of your problems don't mean, don't mean, a damn thing
When you in the winners circle
The top feels so much better than the bottom
[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I woke up this morning with a fever for life
A liver full of patron, half a belief in the Christ
Flights from New York home,
my bitch tweaking from nights
That I never answered the phone
I fought my whole fucking life, that ain't nothing new
with my whip just like my chains
Just so that niggas can say I changed
Like I did all of this work to stay the same
I feel like David Blaine
Disappearing like the Mayans
except a nigga made it rain
And I'm stepping out of Hermes to whip on angels wings
I wonder if Cam can really see me from my South By shows
in a moat
Fuck losing my balance, I'm in Miami with my talents
Fucking up the ballots
Vic Mensa for president, never claimed to be a reverend
I used to ride a bike on days that I was drug peddling
That hood medicine
Another victim of the drug sentencing
Lock him up make him a good citizen
Champagne, champagne, champagne, welcome to the winner's circle
Welcome to the winners circle
All of your problems don't mean, don't mean, a damn thing
When you're in the winners circle
The top feels so much better than the bottom
I know, I've been down that road
I've been there before
But days don't feel the same no more
And now we on, And now we on
When the world is on your shoulders everybody wants to know you
