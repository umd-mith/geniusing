Young nigga, chasin' millions
Took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
I used to want a coupé and a thick bitch
Now all I see is dead presis, got a sixth sense
Every day I'm on the block I'm thinking, this' it
My nigga outta town showed me how to flip bricks
He said, "Fuck this rap shit, this how you get rich"
They watchin' for that dirty money, I can't spend shit
I gotta feed the fam, I came up with a plan
I need some extra hands to help me move all these grams, for real
They see a young nigga stuntin', now they want you killed
Gotta watch out for these youngins tryna pay they bills
I swear to god I liked it better back when I was broke
I'm paranoid, I gotta keep my eyes on all these folks
Never been a fool, ridin' with the tool
Early in the mornin', takin' nephew to school
They say I changed, I swear I'm the same dude
Everything the same, I just change how I move
Young nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
They told me I'd be dead or in prison
I'm just young nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
They told me I'd be dead or in prison
My big brother prolly be somewhere up in the feds
My lil brother prolly be somewhere in jail or dead
Thank god a nigga used his head
I was stuck off in the slump just trynna get ahead
I was just like you
But I - seen a way out then what I do?
I had to put my mind to it
Niggas kept hatin', but I had to grind through it
Bitch, I define music
I ain't quit when shit got hectic
I did it on my own, niggas gotta respect it
And this shit for my young niggas, in the hood with no father
The shit I seen in these streets encouraged me to go harder
And this shit is off the top, my phone died, I got no charger
Keep it real with your self, I promise you, you'll go farther, eh
And these niggas didn't believe me
But now the whole world need me
Young nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
They told me I'd be dead or in prison
I'm just young nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
They told me I'd be dead or in prison
