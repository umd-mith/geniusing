Ain't enough smoke in the world
That help me ease my stress
Ain't enough lean in the world
That help me ease my stress
Ain't enough molly in the world
That help me ease my stress
Ain't enough money in the world
But I can guarantee ima get it
Young boy get money it's nothin
But all these niggas really see is me stuntin
Young savage for the money im huntin
Paper taste you can wait im runnin
If shit ain't lookin good ima take me some
Got some young shooters and they keep ones
Nigga you can just blame it on the place we from
Ain't enough smoke Ain't enough lean
You ain't did what I did
You ain't seen what I've seen
All this stress for a nigga 18
Started from the bottom
Now I'm living my dream
Gotta go hard do this shit for my team
I be in the booth all work no play
All this stress make my hair turn gray
And my bitch wanna fuck tryna mess with my day
Fucking with these beats, I'm the next Kanye
king
I'll kill a nigga dead if he get in my way
Say ain't enough money in the world
Don't waste my time with these girls
And You thought she was your world
But she'll fuck for diamonds and pearls
Street shit it'll drive a nigga insane
Nigga get money now that's a big change
I want the cars and the hoes and the big chains
I want the Gucci and the Louie and the big names
All black two sitter when I switch lanes
Car cost a crib I just leave my shit plain
Foreign bitch, I don't even know the bitch name
Stay schemin'.. day dreamin'
I don't wanna live a life with no meanin
I don't want a 9 to 5
I just wanna lay, call up my maid
Cause a nigga hate cleanin
Work hard cause you know I like Neimans
Where the money at? You know I stay feinin
Young nigga keep squares out my circle man
