I don't know what the fuck these pussy ass niggas talking 'bout
As soon as I got that muthafucking check, I went and bought me 20 guns
I'm not worried bout a muthafucka, not worried bout a soul
If a nigga lookin' for me, he know how to find me
North 10th
I just want to make sure I go out like Tony
I want to go out like Tony Montana
They calling me Bibby Gambino
Trap out the corner like Nino (Trap out the corner)
These rappers be stealing the lingo
I heard that you work with the people
I don't want to meet you my verses are lethal
I'm riding with birds in the regal that eagle
All you fuck niggas Donnie Brasco
I get mad tho, drop the cash flow
Let the Mac go, keep 'em masked tho
And most of these niggas is phony
They pussy I call 'em jabroni
My lil baby choppa is on me, I pray that I go out like I'm Tony
I pray that I end up like I'm Diddy
Young nigga got keys to the city
Riding around town with the fifty
Ready to die bitch I'm Biggie
'Bout to go cop me a Bentley, hollow tips all up in the semi
Ay who that is riding in that new Benz right there
It's that fuck nigga Bibby
That be the fuck niggas hatin'
Hate to see young niggas make it
Them games my niggas don't play it
Threaten my life Imma spray it
Niggas hate I'mma stunt in they faces
Run the check up and throw it to they faces
Young nigga sell jugs out the vacant
Lil Chris in the cut, he gon' blaze 'em
Pussy nigga try to run we gon' chase him
Dope spot had the whole east baking
Free G Gill out the feds he face it
25 years cause the police racist
For bucks who up you know he’ll take it
No limit ass nigga, and I'm grinding
Young nigga got the  city all behind me
All these rappin' ass niggas try'na sign me
You are just an actor, you are not a factor
If a bitch try'na set me up I'mma wack her
Pop wasn't around, I'm a young fresh bastard (Aye)
