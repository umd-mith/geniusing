Now this some bad weed
My day starts out light, but ends up very heavy as the night approach
When I take flow from all that smoke that I smoke, no joke
As I commence to take flight its gotta be first class cuz this ass
Could give a fuck about coach....bitch
Now as I lay me in the cut gettin' fucked up
Puffin on blunts and comin' up with some mo of dat funky stuff
Rough and tough is not enough to keep my focus
No its that hocus pocus abracadabra smoke just
Fills up the room as I breathe again
Once more from the ghetto its them braids and
When flossing in my Benz with my friends it begins
Smell the aroma puttin' you in a coma
Its dat super stinky dank that'll make ya faint go blank
its probably all that chronic that I smoke
Oh How we love it when ya fire it up
layin in da cut gettin real fucked up
Its a new day new day truly ain't nathin changed
Fall up out my bed to the same ol' thangs
Your averaged, everyday black surrounded, bar-b-que, a little weed
Its some niggas with some bass pounding
One o'clock is the time to raise
Take a shower brush my teeth and correct my braids
Now listen up to what I say because this type of shit, it happens everyday and
In the summer its a pool
In the winter its a smoke hole
How we smoke? (we smoke to the maximum)
Doin our thing kickin' back relax and um
We like to smoke, we like to smoke, we like to smoke baaaby
(I pledge allegiance to the bags of marijuana)
We like to smoke, we like to smoke, we like to smoke baaaby
We like to smoke, we like to smoke, we like to smoke baaaby
We like to smoke, we like to smoke, we like to smoke baaaby
(I pledge allegiance to the bags of marijuana)
