[Kanye West]
This song right here changed my life… come on, come on!
God showed me the way, now the devil can’t break me down
Between the girls and the jewelry
The devil tryin’ lure me, it fury me
(Jesus walks with me)
My pastor's shakin’ his head
He ain’t sure of me, but surely
(Jesus walks with me)
They asked, do you say your prayers at least two a week?
I ain’t talking to God, I know what I’ve been doin’ G
Do you know how I be embarrassed?
My prayers sound like Ben Stiller’s on Meet the Parents
And I ain’t good,
what they give us this day
The slaves is trying to give us this free
I’m trying to give us this pay
Man, you know how ‘dem strippers was
We was all ghetto fabulous
All at the rooms in the Sybaris
From this jacuzzi water, can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cartier lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses
For me I almost died, falling asleep in them Benzes
It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And He gives me direction when I can’t decide
He is alive
How can you tell me that He ain't when I said
[Hook]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)
And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me)
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong
Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African
cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer
keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that
[Verse 3: Mase]
Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choices: kill him, or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio playing
Is cause you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats wit knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
That your favorite artist (shhh)
I know you hear that (huh?)
You wanna fear that? (what?)
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who re up for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it
Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of Him
