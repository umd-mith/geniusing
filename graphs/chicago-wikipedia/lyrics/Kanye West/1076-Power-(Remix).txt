Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people
We living in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches; you know what time it is, watch us
They can’t stop us, the prophets, biatches!
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
(No one man should have all that power)
[Verse 1: JAY Z]
Rumble, young man, rumble
Life is a trip, so sometimes we gonna stumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you’ll feel like it’s only one you
Now you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, "Is this what it’s all come to?"
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you
They're trying to Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
Tell her this
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
(No one man should have all that power)
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now when I walk in, everybody do the "Power" clap (clap, clap, clap)
Fresh for the club, I just took a half an hour nap (clap, clap, clap)
I seen people go crazy when the whole world in our lap (clap, clap, clap)
My socket was out the plug, now it’s time to get the power back (clap, clap)
I seen people abuse power, use power, misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, it’s a new hour
Now we all ain’t going be American Idols
But you can least grab a camera, shoot a viral,
huh
Take the power in your own hands
I’m a grown man, doing my grown dance
I don’t stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I’m on my Van Gogh, I don’t hear shit
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
(No one man should have all that power)
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now everything I’m rhyming on cause a Ramadan
Been a don, praying for the families lost in the storm
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I’mma drop 'em in Islam
They say as-salamu alaykum say wa alaikum assalam
That’s no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom
Now the question is, how we going stop the next Vietnam
Keep Flex out of Korea, cause you know he drop bombs
[Break: Swizz Beatz]
Showtime
Hey, yo, Yeezy
Stop playing with these people, man
They want see you act all crazy in this motherfucker, man
Take that jacket off and go crazy on them niggas, man
You know what I’m talking about
What do it mean to be the boss
It mean second place is the first one who lost
The crucifixion, the being nailed to the cross
Truth or fiction,
it’s a hell of a cost, do the dishes
I’m about to hit that Jeff Gordon
Michael Jordan, the only one more important
But I be feeling like Jordan when I’m recording
‘Cause every time I record, I dunk and slap the boards
I don’t know what these rappers gonna do afterwards
Prolly spaz like I might do at the awards
Huh, I got the whole crowd going crazy
Homie, I should be rewarded
Gettin' money, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh
Eating Wheaties,
drinkin' Fiji, being greedy, huh
Don’t even think you can allude to the rumors
I’m immune to the boos, I’ma prove to you losers
It’s all in time, my nigga
See, I dreamed my whole life that I could rhyme with Jigga
Now Jay my big brother
and B my lil sister
And excuse me, but you can’t see my lil sister
Number one sound across the board, hey
Number one now and forevermore, hey
Number one rule is niggas don’t hate
Maybe I’ll drop the album, nah, all y’all gotta wait
And on the net, they showing pictures of my Cali place
My Maybach in NY, but it still got the Cali plates
All my old girls know that I’m the one that got away
I think about at Christmas and play some Donny Hathaway
And keep my bulletproof hater coat on
Looking at some photos that I’m looking crazy dope on
Hand up, talking shit, yeah, I get my Pope on
And go home with something to poke on
That’s what Dre said, but this what Ye said
How Ye doing? Who Ye screwin?
That’s for my dick to know, before you get to know him
She ain’t give you ass, that pussy fictional
I gotta give her the eviction note
‘Tis, get yo’ ass out, bitch, vamonos
Five seconds to the song and we getting close
I got the power, motherfucker, if you didn’t know
Chill, chill, chill, chill, man
Chill, Ye, chill
Shit’s burned up already
It’s over
