[Hook]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my lights
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
But how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

[Verse 1]
I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door..
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know
That you know

[Bridge]
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you and I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know

[Bridge 2x]
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know

That you know, ohhh
