And the Grammy goes to...
'The College Dropout'
Kanye West
Umm, ya'll might as well get the music ready cause this is gonna take a while
Umm, when I had my accident, I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death. If you had the opportunity to play this game of life, you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don't appreciate their moment until its passed.
but umm. Right now, is my time and my moment, thanks to the fans
thanks to the accident
Roc-A-Fella
Jay Z,
Dame Dash
my mother,
everyone that has helped me and I plan to celebrate. I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champaign every chance I get cause I'm at the Grammys baby
I know... I know everybody ask me that question, they want to know, "what Kanye is getting well louder, he's gonna do something crazy." Everybody want to know what I would do if I didn't win...
I guess we'll never know.
