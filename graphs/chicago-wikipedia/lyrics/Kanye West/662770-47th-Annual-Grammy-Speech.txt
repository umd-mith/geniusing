Y'all might as well get the music ready because this finna' take a while
Umm, When I had my accident I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death,
If you had the opportunity to play this game of life
you need to arpeeeciate every moment
a lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed
Crowd applauds
And then, you got to tell those Al Bundy stories "You remember when I ?"
thanks to god
thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, Dame Dash,
my mother,
Rhymefest
And I plan to celebrate, I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champagne every chance I get becasue i'm at the grammys baby!
I know everybody's asking the question, they wanted know "I know he's going to wild out, I know he's going to do something crazy"
Everbody wanted to know what I would do if I didn't win.
Moment of silence
I guess we'll never know.
Crowd cheers
