I'd like to thank everybody who came out tonight to rock with me.
You could have been anywhere in the world. You could have been anywhere in the world...
This is the part of the show where I start complaining about shit, justifying shit, but you know how it is.
I'm just happy to be making music and happy to be able to perform this shit for you all
You know with this album, we didn't drop no single for radio; we ain't have no big NBA campaign or nothing like that
we ain't even got no cover.
We just made some real music
Back when I used to make albums and shit like a couple years ago, 3 years ago, like 4 years ago
we'd go away and work on an album for like 5 months or something
we'd always have to hold the album til like August or September for the perfect moment or some shit. Because it means that you're probably gonna sell more, get more audience and radio and shit
But, honestly, at this point, when I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more.
And, honestly, at this point
I could give a fuck about selling a million records
as long as I can put out an album this summer that you guys can rock to all motherfucking summer.
Y'all don't tell me I'm gonna sell more records. Because at this point, I don't really give a fuck about outside opinions.
All I give a fuck about is my clique-clique-clique....
