You keep it going man
You keep those books rolling
You pick up all those books that you're gonna read and not remember
Then you get your bachelor's
Then you get your masters
Then you get your masters' masters
Then you get your doctorate
And then when everyone says quit
You show them those degrees, man
When everyone says "Hey, you're not working, you're not making any money"
You say "You look at my degrees, and you look at my life
Yeah, I'm 52!
So what?
Hate all you want, but I'm smart, I'm so smart
And I'm in school
All these guys out here making money all these ways
And I'm spending mine to be smart!
You know why?
Cause when I die buddy
You know what's gonna keep me warm?
That's right, those degrees."
