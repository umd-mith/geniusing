[Pusha T]
Malice found religion
Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birdseye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons no room for George
Fear of God
This art imitate my life
You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villian like candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata
feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex,
who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
And sold your dreams, you don’t know who did it
I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it
I need more drinks and more lights
Hot American Apparal girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Its like a crip said: “I got way too many blues for any more bad news”
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don’t believe in yesterday
What’s a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I’m got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shh
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m going after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, its like that ya’ll
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about 2 things, my black balls
[Pusha T]
Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I’m drawing from both sides, I’m Siamese
The tug of war opens the door,
Rip me apart and see what’s inside this pinata
One chapter of black magic, I’m Harold Potter
Relationships with their fathers won’t allow us to bloom
I swear this Vegas nights was awesome
em
the
we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I’m muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih
Yeah
[Kanye West]
It’s hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention
As long as I’m in Polo’s they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the Worl’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick
And I assisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, fans can't resist it
Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!
