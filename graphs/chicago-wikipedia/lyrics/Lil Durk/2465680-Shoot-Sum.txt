Blamma man, blamma man
They shootin' shit like cameramen, cameramen
They hoppin' out that mini van, that mini van
Off flats they kill some (gang)
Off that O they gon' kill some' (gang)
Cause them my brothers
Gang, gang
Blamma shit, niggas be too caught up with this rappin' shit
Actin' shit, bloggers can't come round me with that camera shit
Teddy bears, baby bottle, we shoot up, yo candle lit
News cast, he damn near dead, he trendin' off of channel 6
No vacay, call THF, he bring that AK
Ray J, talkin' one wish we leave him vacay
Block nigga, got a couple millions, I can't stop nigga
Heard he puttin' his Xannies on his dope, and we can't shop wit him
Felony, heard you out on six bonds you tellin' me
Fresh out and you sellin' guns plus you mailin' weed
And you takin' pictures with the gang, who you here to see?
And I think his ass a rat, pussy we ain't got no teeth
Blamma man, blamma man
They shootin' shit like cameramen, cameramen
They hoppin' out that mini van, that mini van
Before this shit, I been the man, been the man
Off flats they kill some (gang)
Off that O they gon' kill some' (gang)
Cause them my brothers
Gang, gang
Hit his ass up, close range, he ain't see me blowin'
Barrell on that F'N super small like a BeBe gun
No show, skeet off in that Cad then I did the dash
I need plenty cash, you know how I rock on any block
Like Milly, yeah
Features less then 10? getcho silly ass, really?
Everything n for nuski noolin in the nity
And she just sucked me off for a 30 and some Remy
I fuck the wrong tender
After I nut, I don't really want her with me
And my watch like 30 plus, I got the papers wit it
Heard they tote them 30s, free Zoo my nina wit me
Blamma man, blamma man
They shootin' shit like cameramen, cameramen
They hoppin' out that mini van, that mini van
Off flats they kill some (gang)
Off that O they gon' kill some' (gang)
Cause them my brothers
Gang, gang
