What they sneak dissing 'bout? Got shooters to get 'em out
For a feature from me, a nigga a get and gone
My niggas killers, my niggas killers
I'ma amber his ass and now niggas missing
I'm talking amber alert, amber alert
My shooters they shoot first I'm talking amber alert
Where I'm from we get em gone I'm talking amber alert
Not a nigga missing, talking amber alert
Can't no nigga say Durk ain't never posted up
Two gun cases, taking chances if the police come
No 52 bars, behind bars he 52 in that bitch
I said street niggas strong like bleach nigga
Forty turn a sweet nigga, caught a case and now a weak nigga
The price is right, call Bob Barky off the speed nigga
Nigga close to 'em, I'ma do 'em for that fee nigga
$1500 on my Balenciagas
Niggas mad at you, they in that jam you ain’t send em' nothing
You lying in yo raps boy you be fronting
A-Amber his ass like oh
Niggas act like they got it, IG gon show money
I spend it, can't die with it or I can't grow money
Had millions, back in 93 ninety shows from me
When I say bro in that cut I ain't just talking lyrics
I got niggas thinking my shoes is on its period” (Red bottoms)
I side with them and got them calling saying "I can't"
Got my deal got these niggas in they feelings
Put two bricks on 'em, he dead by six something
How you hit that that lick and ain't get nothing?
So quit stunting, just quit fronting
I'm flexing and finessing I be shitting on 'em
