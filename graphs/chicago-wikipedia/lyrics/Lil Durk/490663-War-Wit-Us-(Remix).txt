[Verse 1 - Lil Durk]
How you want war and you ain't eating?
What they gon' do if you ain't breathing?
Bodies back to back, bitch we ain't even
Bitch I'm in that pussy cause I'm so conceited
Word around town that you sneak dissing
Bullets must be blank cause they keep missing
Face up on that flyer if you want attention
You just want some fame boy you ain't in it
Better get to ducking if my name's mentioned
I hopped into that foreign, bitch I'm lane switching
And bitch I'm OTF and I ain't switching
Niggas see I'm hot and they want me gone
I heard his ass was singing like he OVO
Bitch go cop a Rollie not a rodeo
And when we in the building it's a rollie show
And I be sipping lean while they smoking dope

[Hook - Lil Durk]
War with us, they don't want war with us
Them bullets go bang, bitch them bullets go bang
No war with us, they don't want no war with us
Them bullets go bang, bitch them bullets go bang
And you can't hang where my niggas hang
Cause where we hang all we do is bang
No war with us, they don't want no war with us
Them bullets go bang, bitch them bullets go bang
[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
It’s Guwop in this bitch and I got shooters too
Snatch all the clothes out the mall like the looters do
And all my bitches got them racks, got a Hooters crew
My rims are gorgeous, riding on forgies big as hula hoops
Fuck the prosecution, I find a revolution
Sell white Rolls Royces with focals, inspired it on constitution
Whipping up babies that child abuse
That dog food, hard, and powder too
And 12 rottweilers that I feed gunpowder
They bite, don't bark or growl at you
These young niggas'll torture you, cartel will be proud of me
Vato Poma Coto told me the federales onto you
I told Vato man fuck the feds and watch Guwop, they 'posed to do
You local rappers dissing me, I’ll put you on the local news
