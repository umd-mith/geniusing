[Intro]
What your life like?
The streets is my hustle, I've been through the struggle
Where them people be with you, but they really don't love you
I'm addicted to sidewalks,
Gotta gain that time lost
I'ma ask them niggas, tell me what your life like
Tell me what your life like, nigga tell me what your life like
Tell me what your life like
Nigga tell me what your life like
You can't turn up on them social sites, thinkin' it's gon' be alright
Beef at 6, he dead by 6 o'clock, on the dot that night
Ain't easy where I'm at,
why? Stick up man, he love that shit
Go to jail, she fuck your man, you write and call, don't love that bitch
I ride with too much auto-tune, I heard that shit before
This my life, I run my life,
your life, I seen that shit before
My mixtape drop, I crash the site, don't be lurkin' after night
Shooters hungry and these snakes is bologna, that's their appetite
Welcome to these city streets
No gang related car crash, and he still won't get no money from these city streets
My crazy life, no YG
Ask the Lord, why me?
I know my name, it's on my ID
The streets is my hustle, I've been through the struggle
Where them people be with you, but they really don't love you
I'm addicted to sidewalks,
I'm workin', no time off
Gotta gain that time lost
I'ma ask them niggas, tell me what your life like
Life like
Tell me what your life like, nigga tell me what your life like
Tell me what your life like, nigga tell me what your life like
They say the murder started after Ls, not my fault, got shit to tell
Take it wrong, they got it after "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Nigga this ain't what you want, got that call, they cancelled 20 shows
(Damn)
That's money down the drain, I got kids, don't take it wrong
Fuck all this peace shit, I'm with this beef shit
Don't ask me to leave shit, if I do it won't mean shit
Like will I be rich? 10 years, will I be shit?
After all I am the shit
Got the label all on my dick
Name my niggas' names in a song, police match the face
I do it for the Vine not knowin' that it's buildin'  case
Started from the building base, I got a bill to pay
Eh
Why the fuck these niggas steady hate?
The streets is my hustle, I've been through the struggle
Where them people be with you, but they really don't love you
I'm addicted to sidewalks,
Gotta gain that time lost
I'ma ask them niggas, tell me what your life like
Tell me what your life like, nigga tell me what your life like
Tell me what your life like, nigga tell me what your life like
