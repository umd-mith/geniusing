Where you was at when I was in that war?
I had nobody but me and my boys
You niggas frauds yall ain't making noise
But I ain't take it personal
And I told you I was down to ride
Now where you was when I was fightin' all them homicides
But you wasn't with me in that war
But I don't take nothin' personal
I'm in that field where it get real
With plastic ass niggas playin' with the steel
Pussy change for a little change
Try to hang where I hang and then you got banged
I done see the shit happen boy
I ain't playin' my young boys they be clappin' boy
OJ
and T-Roy
Mikey Ikey
Chief Wuk
I tell them niggas go free Mikey Lord
These niggas they be bitches they be psych'ing boy
Fuck who don't like me boy
I'm a bull in this shit
My first bank a case I had to calm down
Caught a sack and
lost J Money F-- around
I gotta do another round
I lost my guy that's when I went and made 100 rounds
Now watch my niggas go bananas
My homie got head shout out to Montana
Chop 'em down like Montana
I'm on the block I'm serving white, that Montana
They told me I won't be shit
They ask for hooks and features on some free shit
I'm on some Steve shit
RIP Steve shit
And I told you I was warning you
I was on D town I was on Normal too
Abnormal
Niggas pussy snitching on me informin'
And I ain't with the bullshit
I got a deal and I still be on that bullshit
I'ma warn your ass another time
Call my nigga numba 9
Nuski got the strap still
Make your family go and make a will
Police niggas go and make a deal
OTF I'm in this shit for real
