Ain’t a killer, don’t push me
I know a lot of killas pussy
And I see them niggas looking
Killers stay around me nigga
I’m hearing all the rumors
I stay around shooters
All my niggas, they do this
Ain’t a killer, don’t push me nigga
Ain’t a killer, don’t push me nigga
I’m hearing all these rumors
Ain’t a killer, don’t push me nigga
These niggas ain’t loyal, these niggas ain’t for you
Spreading rumors, these niggas don’t love you
These niggas act real, these niggas talk guns
Never let the MAC squeal, I know my niggas will
Cause they ready for it
Never got my shit snatched, you ain’t get your bitch back
Run up on em, give me that nigga
See me in that Jag, what you looking at
While theses drugs spin back, we ain’t playing fair
Hard as Chiraq, you ain’t coming here
Diss me, I don’t care where you from nigga
Niggas ain’t welcome here
Seen killers, tell killer and they rat
I don’t know shit, what happened
Applause on sight, niggas cocked
Bricks for the low, then I tax
And I do what I rap niggas
And I don’t fuck with these rap niggas
So you better adapt nigga
ain’t a killer but don’t push me nigga
Tryna rob, shooters at his top, shooters on the block
Shooters all I got in the bushes nigga
Act up, we gon whack something
Front me ten bricks and won’t bring him back nothing
Feed the whole squad Imma give my squad some
You won’t get your squad none
Chopper with bosses,
went iced out the cross
Guns in the attic, got coke in the closet
And we ready for war, and we at your door
All of these niggas act like they my niggas
These niggas ain’t with us
These niggas ain’t killers
So who pushed em?
