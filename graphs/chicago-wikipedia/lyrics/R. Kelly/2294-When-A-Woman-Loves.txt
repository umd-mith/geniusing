When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl she raised me
And I'm forever indebted
I'm forever indebted to her cause
She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she’s got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I like to tell her
That I’m forever indebted
It would never die young
Even when I’m dead and gone
I’m gonna love her from the sky
Cause she’s given me something
That no other woman has given me
