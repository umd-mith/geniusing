Big screen
Hollywood lights
She wants the big screen
Hollywood lights
She wants it
dookie chain
Got a little hoochie game and then the Gucci came
The Ultima and then the Mustang
Lookin' in the mirror, "Aye" she must say
Diane Keaton
A gangster she was seekin'
With two then the three can keep a secret
Bein' exposed to the goals of a baller
So she drove a Rolls with a Prada
Put up the ?, rocked Fendi
Rarely Ed Hardy she said the shit was trendy
Married to the mob like she was Miss Wendy
She would spend the bread of men instead of spendin'
Her own, her tone was eccentric
The Gulf coast was home for this mistress
Felt pain, but shoppin' killed this
Then a little bit of Wayne lent her something for this princess
Baby girl you're dangerous
Everybody know that you love those lights
Baby girl you're dangerous
So dangerous, but it's only right
I'm back in your life
Return Of The Jedi
L.A. for a night, then return on the red eye
It's a party in your closet
I swear it's going off
I see it's Dolce & Gabbana
Viktor & Rolf
Ann Roth
Uh, huh
Not to shabby
You're good around celebs, not too laughy
So you deserve a rapper and/or athlete
And/or something more than just a backseat
Action, I had more beats than I had rhymes
Now they say you got more girls than you got time
To spend with 'em
So I throw them all on the team
Only problem is, I see they all want a ring, ring
Let me tell you once ting
It's gonna take a lot to be down with the king, king
Down, down with the king
Now are you really ready for the big screen?
