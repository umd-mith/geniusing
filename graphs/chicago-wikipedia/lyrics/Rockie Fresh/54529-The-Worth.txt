You know the world's gone ridiculous
When niggas act like bitches
And these bitches think they niggas
Man I just can't frame this picture
But I fathomed and I figured
Now I'mma do it bigger
I'm about to give them bars
They gon' think I'm selling liquor
And I ain't steal no remote
But I'mma bout to take control
These people look for changes
If they trying to pay a toll
And I swear I got that heat
I keep it hotter than the solar
Good kid but every Christmas
I knew I was getting coal
Getting colder with these flows
Man I hope they feel the breeze
And I know I'm not a god
But women come on bended knees
Anytime you going hard
Then that money comes with ease
But it costs to be the boss
So be prepared to pay these fees
And don't ball outside your means
When I said it then I meant it
Because stunting ain't for all
If you ain't got it then don't spend it
And don't fake it till you make it
Nigga, work until you get it
When you get up in this game
Then make a name and reinvent it
And I don't want to work no more
Get money off of what I'm worth
This is what I've come to
It's all I can do
Rock it by myself I do it
Solo like a red cup
Eating but I'm high so
They gon' say a nigga fed up
And now I'm in the running
It's clear that I got the funding
And they tell me I'm the truth
I'm everything that they'd better be
Rockie is the leader I'm in front
Where all them cameras go
And if your life a movie, ho
You shoot yourself like Plaxico
Burr, it's cold, it's freezing
Plus your boy is angel fly
I could've played in Anaheim
I've been trying to get my shine
Now I'm 'bout to light it up
I've been staring at the top
It's time I get invited up
