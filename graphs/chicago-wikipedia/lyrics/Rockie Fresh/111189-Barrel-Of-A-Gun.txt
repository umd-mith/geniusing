[Intro]
In the barrel of a gun
With the girl girl girls
With the golden son
This is just The Genesis, homie it’s the beginning
When I think about my mother who put your boy through summer school
When I was failing classes, waiting kiss these teachers’ ass
And I think about my pops who worked that 5 to 5
On the nights I should’ve died just to keep the dream alive
Now I’m standing here with 20 gold chains, I never run
Try to harm either
You gon have to meet the barrel of a gun
You only got one shot
You only got one shot
You only got one shot
Don’t fuck it up, yea
Out here talkin all violent, I prefer to move silent
I know I’m on fire, but ain’t nobody flyer
These niggas say they hustle when they life is like the wire
Well my shit a little different, I’m living like Breaking Bad
I got them white boys cooking up in the lab
