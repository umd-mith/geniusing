I’ve got dreams of rollin’ ‘round the city
Screamin’ out “money ain’t a thing”
But you know I gotta get it with my niggas
It’s better when your circles stay the same
And they wonder how I’m feelin’ right now
They ask me how I’m feelin’ right now
Said I’m feelin’ like a billion right now
I’m feelin’ like a billion right now
Welcome to Electric Highway
– I’m doin’ things my way
My life is an example of exactly how the grind pay
Ice blue diamonds like bottles of that Bombay
I came a long way to Rosé from that André
Been out this world and I ain’t never need Galaxy Foams
Niggas be Twitter-hatin’ on me no Galaxy phones
But them niggas need loans – I’m paid and livin’ good
Come and spend a day in these Jordan’s, homie, I wish you could
Drive a DeLorean,
feelings of being born again
The same you, it’s just now, you got some more to spend
More to give, improving the way your people live
It’s gettin’ late but we still ridin’
I came far but got so far to go
While I’m travellin’ down this long and this winding road
Told these hoes like Usher told ‘em: “you don’t have to call”
These hoes’ll try to milk you, watch out for them Dairy Queens
I used to rock that ice cream when I hit the scene
Now it’s white mountain nearin’, other rappers I ain’t hearin’
I’d rather listen to Taylor Swift than most of you niggas
Goin’ to the future
We goin’ to the future
Just ride with me
Don’t be afraid to ride with me
You are still Driving 88
Ridin’ on Electric Highway
