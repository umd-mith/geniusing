[Verse 1 - Rockie Fresh]
It's like you can have it all, And niggas wouldn't get you
They see what you've become, With no idea of what you've been through
A lot of people faking, it really becomes a issue
When you gone, They saying fuck you and you won they fucking with you
Man I just don't understand, But I do me, I can't do it any bigger
Getting pamper by these women, While im sitting on these niggas
This is just what I would figure, This is just what i'd expect
Anytime you getting money, Then you bout to get respect
But you gon' find a problem, When you find success
The ones that used to hate you, Feel like they know you the best
Man I wish I had known, That it would come with all this stress
Would have smoked a little more, Maybe cared a little less
But I'm already in it, I plan to be here long
These niggas say they got me, But I know they'll do me wrong
They wanna knock me off, to see me down
They always try but, I will never fall
And They Don't Understand Why
See I smoke weed, just to ease my mind but
They Don't Understand Why
I live good, cuz I'm on my grind but
They Don't Understand Why
I don't love these hoes, so when they don't go then
Girl you gotta say bye
And at the end I hope they see that ima be me but
They Don't Understand Why
[Verse 2 - Tayyib Ali]
Uh, Tryna make it to the top, but they don't understand
Never fucked wit me, but now you tryna be my man
Shake my hand, wanna know if shit cool now
I wonder why, prolly because im that dude now
They played some bets, and I ain't made a check
Hilarious, we on our rap shit while these hoes tryna marry us
Fans flash cameras, they see me and their hands is up
From Philly to Atlanta, running all over the atlas bruh
I just do my own thing, life is too special
Riding in my own lane, going 80 in a Jetta
On a road to the bright lights, shining like a night light
The world gon' be mine, and you can take it if I let you
That won't happen, Me and Rockie bout to be on
Grinding in patience, if you don't understand what I'm saying
Then we party hard and stay fly
Working for this great life, a young nigga that stay high
And They Don't Understand Why
