Bitch, I'm out here grinding,
crib like king of diamonds
You can catch me wearing (two chains)
yeah, I’m shining
With my nigga freshgoods,
making sure them checks good
Gotta feed the homies
real players with respect would
These flashing lights is blinding, go get them a visor
Call the beat a gas leak and I set this shit on fire
And I don't fuck with liars, only tell the truth
Honesty is key and that is in and out the booth
Ball while they in the bleachers, so high they can't reach us
I dropped out of college and made more dough than my teachers
Definition of swagging, all off of my passion
One time for real niggas that's out there making it happen
A middle finger to them niggas who say that we ain't fly
We above all the drama cause we out here staying high
You gon' see a real nigga when you look me in the eye
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
Now while in deep thought, when I was high
Thought about a time that I wasn't even picked to be the leader of the Chi
See the jewels and they try to play Cam
Tell ‘em they can dip if they ain’t running with the set
I'll be in the sky ‘cause we riding on a jet
And all I ask from the people is respect
In return they're gon' get the same thing
They took a young player from the Chi off the bench
Now they're about to watch the whole game change
Money maker, made a promise I can’t be no broke nigga
That would be a let-down like unraveling a broke swisher
Me and success is a dope picture, you on the scene then I fuck with ya
Versace forever, draped like I’mma king
My Jesus piece yellow
flooded like Melpomene
Invest in my niggas, watch the joy that it brings
All these beautiful bitches, such a beautiful thing
I own all them autos, I bone the mulattoes
Balling what we do, balling what we do, balling what we do
Wide body Benz hanging with my crew, yeah
