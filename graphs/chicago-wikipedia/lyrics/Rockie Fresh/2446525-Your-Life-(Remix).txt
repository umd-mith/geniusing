[Intro]

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Walk with me, come talk with me
I was in Chicago when the boss hit me
Gotta know he a real nigga
Keep it real, don't fuck with niggas
I done heard too much in my lifetime
You know people say what they gon do
And people act like it's all facts
But most of the time that shit untrue
This is why I only work on my damn songs
Fuck a bitch with my headphones on
Smoked then I head home
I be pulling up in that red zone
Touchdown, take off again
Plans to be everywhere where Ross has been
Everything real we do not pretend
Young nigga got game with a lot to spend
So what you trynna do
Pretty sure we can work it out
Cause I been through it
I innovated, they imitated
And it's safe to say that I'm an influence
And if I never dropped out of school
Probably never would have found music
Teachers told me that's a dumb move
And I see why cause these racks stupid
I done had all the bad girls
Now I only want good women
One thing about Chicago niggas
They all got a little hood in them
I want a real one that's 365
Who would never cheat, who would never lie
I come and kill it like homocide
We can see the stars if you're down to ride
Let's


[Hook: Rockie Fresh] x2
Feel free to do what you like
I hope I'm the one that you like
You know I'mma always do right
And rarely do I take advice
But I got some suggestions to you
I like how you do what you do
You should come get with the crew
You should come get with the crew


[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Puma sneakers, no laces
Slow money, no patience
In my SS with the T Top
I had a red bone, early breakfast
Dirty birds, I got a dome too
40 mil out in zone 2
Mississipi my home too
Pimping shit in my bone fool
Snow crabs with my day ones
Might blow a bag with a stranger
On a bus stop I just sat back
Nigga ride by wouldn't say nothing
All good til my day came
Top down homie bang bang
R.I.P. to my best friends
These new niggas so sideways
Whole rack on my buckle nigga
Bet another five you wouldn't touch a nigga
FOY's, black bow ties
Gangsta smoother than Russel with it
Chi-town when the snow fall
Big Mike collect phone calls
Conspiracy you'll be home in three
And I said pray for me and that I don't fall


[Hook: Rockie Fresh] x2
Feel free to do what you like
I hope I'm the one that you like
You know I'mma always do right
And rarely do I take advice
But I got some suggestions to you
I like how you do what you do
You should come get with the crew
You should come get with the crew
