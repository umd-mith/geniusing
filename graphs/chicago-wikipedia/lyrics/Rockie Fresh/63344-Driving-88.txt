Yeah ok I heard these hoes lookin', Rockie who they lookin' for
What that nigga doin'? Out here tryin' get his dough
What I say they see it so they call this shit my picture flow
Never been abusive but they call me Mr. Hit-that-Ho
I'm smashing when she twerkin', got lil momma workin'
And she say she not a ho she just felt I was deservin'
She saw me up on twitter couldn't wait to meet in person
Now she tell me I'm the bomb, I need ammo and a turban
I'm about to blow up I tell my haters peace
My shoe collection gotta be a hundred racks at least
It's big business on my table tell my lawyers feast
If you ain't talkin' big business then don't even speak
At high key I give a fuck about a hater
They be laughing at me now, I'm out here getting paper
And I'm
Feeling good feeling great
A lot of twists and turns, but I got my paper straight
On the road to the riches, driving 88
With a couple bad bitches, driving 88
driving 88
Ok I'm hied up, baped out more swag then a Little Wayne
Even got no stripes on, but damn I'm so official
If I ever got some drama I send Dough to come and get you
He a Chi-town nigga all the way down to the gristle
When shout out my homie Casey got these bitches on the d-low
I'm ballin' I feel like Jordan when he hit that shot on Ehlo
Like Rodman I'm on my hustle, you shook up like Bryon Russell
The kush is Jazz purple I'm takin' off from the free-throw
I'm just tryin' to get my cut, choppa chop it down
Watch me throw some money up and these bitches hit the ground
Like uhh aw man, straight body
My new flows remind me of 12 guage shottys
I love when show promoters tell me I get payed shortly
It make my face light up, I feel like Robert Horry
When he hit that shot that made the headlines in the paper
Runnin' team for my city like Kobe do with the Lakers
You got a couple thousand, my nigga that baby weight
Peas and carrots we the business just like Baby say
Hundred million dollars, bad hoes holla
Get my team straight and get rid of all the imposters
