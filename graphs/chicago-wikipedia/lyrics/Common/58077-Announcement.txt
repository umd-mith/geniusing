I'm finna take you to the tip-top, baby
Everybody, I'd like to announce
Throw your hands up when we in the house
Yeah, this is hip hop, baby
And we gonna do this 'til they kickin' us out
Cause, this is hip hop, baby
I'm finna take you to the tip-top, baby
Live from the south side, this one,
hide your gun
Representing Chi Town to the fullest,
raps are bullets
See them rappers? They be duckin'
When Comm be buckin' in the kitchen, fuckin'
got my momma a mink
Think Common is the link
Thought the game was extinct
Lady, them jeans is as slim as Shady
Freestyle paid off
so Lincoln paid me
Now we can push more whips than slavery
Alex Haley of this rap shit, my roots is deep
You heard the bitch in you, yeah I know what's beef
Let it cook and I pop like grease
You thirsty niggas can't shock my feast, ugh
I still love her, she be needin' the dick
When it comes to hip-hop, it's just me and my bitch
Baby,
Valet crashed my Rolls so quickly I bought another
Sorry, Mr. Williams moved out the building
Spot to the top, 50 feet was the ceiling
Well funded it was not gangsta
Came to shitty deals, reminiscing gives me chills
When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie
And I'll be pedaling backwards like a track bike
She don't know the Casio cost a hundred
It's been two years since I done it, now all the rappers want it
What?
As I sit back, relax with Chicago on my back
Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of 'gnac
I probably go to jail but naw, that ain't me
I style crazy and net like Jay Z
The black Kojak
"I get money" and want more stacks
Broads say, "Are you a philosopher?"
Yea yea, I'll philosophize on top of ya
