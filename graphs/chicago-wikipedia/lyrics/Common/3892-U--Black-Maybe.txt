I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe
He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros
the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black...maybe
When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from... from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us
