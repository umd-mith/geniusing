I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate
We partying, yeah got body and
Exotic broads lobbying, Spanish, Somalian
We living in the night looking in the eye
On our paper 'til we get it like Dubai
Chi niggas stand up,
plastic cups
Girls with the drastic butts, that ask for bucks
Bottles of Veuve pop here
And we gonna get around like 2Pac's here
Celebrate like it's new year
Some bomb broads coming, type nuclear
Yeah, it's so ridiculo
Lit the medicinal, passed it give-and-go
Celebrate
In my Paul Smith like an alcoholic
My guys I used to hoop with, is now who I ball with
Tonight she'll be giving conscious, headlights!
Beaming from the Beemer that her momma bought her
I got to act right for her like I'm an author
Married to the game
like Usher we was caught up
Now we got some R&B broads we can call up
You niggas come around keep the wall up
Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things
Hustlers from the go,
For the life, getting bugged tonight
Wait 'til I get my money right
Ah, I knew her when she strip, her name was Chardonnay
My niggas move work even on a holiday
We come from porches and alleyways
I'm the big ticket, don't need no one to validate
Bills ain't so bad, celebrate that
We've come so far, been climbing
Now the clouds they passed us by
C'mon and raise your glass up high
