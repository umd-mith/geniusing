[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Introducin' Chance the Ruthless
Trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid
Loosely based on music
Swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches. deuce deuce I'll shoot ya
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of illusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended
Last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy
Shut up

[Hook]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Igh

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Acid acid, get it? Acid
Melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper
If this was work, I'd get higher-ed
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack
Lickety-split, lickety-slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana split backs
Give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra
I eat it like Idi Amin, you know what I mean
Hit me back when that mean shit
Shut up
Vodka in my Redbull can, very formal
Shot a porno on a rebel cam
Don't be jealous that's the shit that got the devil damned
Yeah you got one banger? Nigga I got several hands
Got me feeling upper echelon
And I ate cheerios for dinner
I broke like 40 bowls I'm the cereal bowl killer
Here's a bunch of mushrooms go run in the woods and find your spirit animal
I want to put my twins in a tower
So I could hoop in my basement and swim in my shower
Choke holding my wine glass
to the noggin
I got holes in my socks and coal in my stocking
Santa was on dirt with all the poor kids in Chatham
So I rode to the north pole with a pole and I shot him
Batman, Gotham
I ought to start selling them
But I ain't even on that
Nananananannanananananannaanananan
