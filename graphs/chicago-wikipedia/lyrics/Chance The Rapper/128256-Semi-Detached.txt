[Intro]
Yooooo Yooooo Yoooo
Will we continue on
String along
We need time
Yooooo Yooooo Yoooo
Will we continue on
String along
We need time
[Verse 1: Cass Lowe]
You reach into the bowl of car keys
Making eye contact, as if to say 'hows that"
Are you fucking happy now
Grab his wrist and wriggle past me
As Jenny licks her lips
Time to teach a young dog tricks
And how to bow
Remember when you couldn't hurt me
We reached a breaking point
As you lit your joint and we crossed the severn bridge
[Hook]
And you kiss him
And I kiss her
We all go home again
[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
She know my favorite flavor skittles
She know everything we argue 'bout
Where everything in our crib at
And every time you walk up out
She know whenever we fighting and whenever we cool
But my favorite thing she know is that she'll never be you
She know she'll never have her song, She know she'll never have my son
She know she'll never have your pain, she'll never have to have a hunch
She know everyone that I lie about, heard every freaking word
She know everything you wonder bout, and it hurt her even worse
Who'd you rather be?
