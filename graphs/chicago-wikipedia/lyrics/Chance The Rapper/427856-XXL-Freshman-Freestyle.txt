Ice, melting in my chain
Pretty as my hair
Ugly as my name
Dirty as my gold
Comfy as my chair
Ugly is my name
Ugly is my name
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
My sword look just like Michael's
He lent it to me, this a house of God
I'm just leasing, he rent it to me
This sentence he penned it too
That's a Gmail, he sent it to me
I can send you his contact, hit him if you in combat
Hit him if you in traffic, even if there ain't no static
That's my G,
he got me shinin'
My hair, he made it tangled
My seed, don't need no lining
A halo fits on an angel
And if the shoe fits, I'll tie his and let the kiddie rap
Finally give the city back, and ask God for a piggy-back
Up on his shoulders I notice, I'm within earshot
I yell, "Thanks for makin' us in your image
You got a good sense of hubris"
