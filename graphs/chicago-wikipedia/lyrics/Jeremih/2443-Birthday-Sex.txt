It's your birthday so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip mo-eezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good, but I know you want to
Cry out
You say you want passion
I think you found it
We switching positions
You feel surrounded
Just tell me where you want
Your gift, girl
Girl you know I-I-I
Girl you know I-I-I
I've been fiending
Wake up in the late nigh dreaming about you
Girl you know I-I-I
Girl you know I-I-I
Don't need candles or cake
Just need your body to make
Birthday sex
Birthday sex
It's the best day of the year, girl
It feels like, feels like
Lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot
See you sexy and them jeans got me on tent
1-2-3, think I got you pinned
Don't tap out - fight until the end
Ring that bell; we gon start over again
We grinding with passion 'cause it's yo birthday
Been at it for hours, I know you thirsty
You kiss me so sweetly, taste just like Hershey's
Just tell me how you want your gift, girl
First I'm gonna take a dive into the water
Deep until I know I pleased that body body
