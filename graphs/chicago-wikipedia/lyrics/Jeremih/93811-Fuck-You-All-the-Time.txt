Early in the morning is when I think about you
I hit you like, "what you saying"
And the morning is when I want to fuck you, yeah
I hit you like "what you saying"
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
M.O.E.T
That's the fuck we sip
That's the fuck we drip
Traphouse still tip
Facetime when I'm gone
She gives me dome from a distance
And she loves to climb on top
Because she loves to walk off limping
Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me?
Because shes knock-kneed
And we've got trees
So Mary, go around
Gotta know, I ate her
She's so sweet, Now or Later
I want that all the time, all the time
Early in the morning is when I think about you
I hit you like, "what you saying"
And the morning is when I want to fuck you,
I hit you like "what you saying"
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
Early in the morning is when I think about you
I hit you like, "what you saying"
And the morning is when I want to fuck you,
I hit you like "what you saying"
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
