Pull off in that foreign
skrr skrr skrr
she thought she seen a beast
A nigga think I’m going
ha ha ha
I got my thing with me
Glo Gang known for glowing
heh heh
all us got a thing a piece
Saying that you blowing, huh huh, but you never seen a piece
I high off this earth boy, I higher than Jesus be
Coming on my turf boy, you gonna need a Jesus piece
Them bullets fly no Nerf boy,
change yo ass like the seasons be
Niggas say they looking for me, I'm with my nina Chiefin' Keef
I'm high off this Earth boy, I'm where Jesus be
Shoot a nigga ass, he don't believe in me
My truck super fast, don't think you leaving me
Tray Savage got the mac, he make it scream for me
He shot the crowd up, he thought he seen a G
Boy roll your loud up, cause you can't chief wit me
I got my 9 tucked, we let it meet a nigga
I'm a cold O'Block ass nigga, I put heat to a nigga
Spent one song on a foreign, ain't got no features with it
I be with some killers and them niggas smoke the loudest weed
They got a lotta guns, they blow you down for me
They rob yo' ass, they find you got some pounds of weed
Shoot a nigga up, he can't get down with me
Like hold up, hold up, rocket launcher on his shoulder
You get hit with that it's over
On that brick ass shit, I told you
Holding my dick where yo' hoes at
Tray Savage got the Mac he blows that
Hollows hit his body, body drop
I got a fucking Glock with a mop
If Sosa say smoke his ass then he gon' get popped
We got 100 chops with Glocks with red dots
