All I care about is money
All I care about is hundreds
Fifties, and Twenties
All I care about is money
Hundreds, Fifties, and Twenties
All I care about is money
All I care about is hundreds
All I care about is fifties
All I care about is twenties
All I care about is my whereabouts
R.I.P. my niggas they in heaven now
That's all I care about now, I keep them weapons 'round
He say he pulling up, we gone wet him down
That's all I care about
Where yo coke boy? My choppa down
You don't wanna hear this choppa sound
Now I gotta bring my choppa 'round
I heard these bitch niggas be plottin' now
My 4-O is a semi now
I don't hang with 50 now
Bitch my watch cost 'bout' 50 now
And my chain cost a HEMI now
And my house cost 4 now
Now I'm tryna make the Forbes now
Sneak diss, yo block a morgue now
This shit getting boring now
A show 50, verse 20, a tweet 10 now
B-u-s-i-n-e-s-s that's my friend now
Niggas sneak dissing, they bitches, I be with Ben now
That's the only nigga I depend on
All I care about get guap, get in and out
The ones I care about, I don't live with now
That's my Granny now, and my Mammi now
I need a Grammy now, for my Granny now
Got my socket now, out a pocket now
Gun tall like Yao, it's my Houston Rocket now
Come through foul, we gone need a ref right now
My gun know martial arts, need a black belt right now
This nigga bitch just hit me up, say she need sex right now
I'm getting to the guap so I ain't on debt right now
This bitch nigga hit me up, say he upset right now
Don't get mad, get a check right now
That's all I am about, all I care about, and wanna hear about
That's all I marry now,
what you'll get buried 'bout
The only thing I know, bitch I'm fetty now
