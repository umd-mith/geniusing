Sosa baby GBE Baby
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'
I’m best friends with Ben shawty
I don't even want you darling
Cuz I'm ballin'
Bitch I'm ballin'
Rollin' up this dope
Pop a nigga something like Crisco
All I do is spend dough

Cuz I'm ballin'
So please bitch stop callin'
Bitch I'm Chief Keef
Every bitch know me
If the bitch don't know me

On these broke niggas, I'm ballin'
Ballin', ballin'

Pockets filled with that green
I just blow it all on my team
Cuz I'm ballin'
Nigga I'm ballin'
Ride around wit my 3 hunnas
All my niggas, we stuntin'
Spendin commas, bitch it's nothin'
And I'm eatin' but I ain't even got a big stomach
Cuz I'm ballin'

Crackin' cards, get back
I gets me a big check
And everything designer but it's mismatch
Cuz I'm Ballin'
I'm Ballin' like Spalding
Trus off my ass
Pockets filled with that cash
Niggas see me, they mad
Bitches see me, they pass out man they fallin'
Now I'm thru talkin'
Cuz I'm ballin', I'm ballin'
Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'

Bitch I'm ballin'
Sippin on that lean
Pockets filled with that green
I just blow it all on my team
Cuz I'm ballin'
Nigga I'm ballin'
