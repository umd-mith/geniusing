Bang
Bang bang

She just really like me for my watch
She just really like me for my car
She just really jock me cuz my gear
She just really want me for my ear
She just really like me for my watch

Holograms on my hand gave me a tanned wrist
Diamonds dancin' on my fist look like a blank disc
Teriyaki suit with the lemon Phantom
Heavy weight, heartburn: Mylanta
Adversaries call me on my Blackberry
Now I'm in the laundry met: Darryl Strawberry
On my cell phone, now I'm on my iPhone
She thought it was a cat phone
Now I'm on my bat phone
Hangin' fangs down like a vampire (Twilight!)
Sapphires dancin' on my hand like a campfire
Camp counselor, livin' in the lap of lux'
Double cheese deluxe
in the penguin tux
She just really jock me cuz my gear
She just really want me for my ear
She just really like me for my watch

Say she don't like a nigga that's gon' squeal
Well listen baby, I'ma keep it real
Hope you know you ain't got shit coming here
Blowed a blunt of kush in the air
And I won't feed you lies to your ears
Cause niggas better calm down before they hear
A lot of gun sounds in the air (bang bang)
I won't wife her keep it pimpin' over here
Gucci shirts, we ain't simple over here (Gucci!)
Fuck nigga mad cause his bitch jockin'
And I be flexin' up the Maseratis, flex!
She just really jock me cuz my gear
She just really want me for my ear
She just really like me for my watch
She just really like me for my car
She just really jock me cuz my gear
She just really want me for my ear
She just really like me for my watch
