Your ice ain't real man that shit fu-fu (Shit fake tho)
Dont start my niggas up, them niggas coo-coo
One word and they'll shoot you
Pistols blasting bullets fly like zoom zoom
I get a lot of money so all these hoes be on me
I don't wanna fuck you bitch you gotta fuck my homie
You ain't gettin' money, can't fool me
Think I'm about to fly out to Cancun man
Your ice ain't real man that shit fu fu (shit fake tho)
Don't stall my niggas up dem niggas coo-coo (3hunna, O'Block)
One word and they'll shoot you
[Verse 2]
Ice on my wrist make me think that I'm a trapper
Try to take my shit, get T-Roy, he gon' blast ya
I don't want relations, I just fuck her then be Casper
