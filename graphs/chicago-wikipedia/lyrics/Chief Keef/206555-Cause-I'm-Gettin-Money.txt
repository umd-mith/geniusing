I smell like I got 100 pounds of blocks on me
It's reeking out the car homie
She wanna freak cause I'm a star low key
Tell me what bitch do not know me
I'ma blow this thing like Odee
Leaning off this act I OD'd
Can't trust a face them niggas plotting on me
And it's all because I'm getting money
Got that bitch off the drugs, she a zombie
She wanna fuck with us, we get money
Bitch is you drunk, you want my Beamer car keys?
Let's see if they got Beamer taxis
Just bought Kay Kay a Beamer car seat
My boys gon' spray, let us see a opp please
I'm Sunny
Bitch I ain't with that lovie dovie
Bitch you just gotta suck and fuck me
Got a pound of that herb, its lovely
Now I'm sparking up, climbing up trees
dope
Don't you see I'm getting high, bitch just leave me alone
Chief Sosa
Busting like I'm Dillinger, got my dumb ass pulled over
I smell like I got 100 pounds of blocks on me
It's reeking out the car homie
She wanna freak cause I'm a star low key
Tell me what bitch do not know me
I'ma blow this thing like Odee
Leaning off this act I OD'd
Can't trust a face them niggas plotting on me
And it's all because I'm getting money
