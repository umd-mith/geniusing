You don't got enough cheese boy fuck wrong with you
You ain't no street nigga can't make no song with you
Boy that ain't yo cheese it don't belong to you
I got so much money I do what I wanna do
Wanna do, do what I wanna do
I got so much money I do what I wanna do
What I wanna do, what I wanna do
How many cars should I buy? Tell me 1 or 2
Got 30 boppers,
power pills, codeine, and that gunja
And I don't do that molly, give that shit to Blood Money
And we don't love these bitches we just fuck them and dump them
And boy don't test me your best bet trying Obama
I pull up in that 'rari screaming boy fuck your Hyundai
And I ain't gonna stop 'till Beyonce my fiancée
I'm flexing on these bitches all gold bottles no Bombay
Take 50 thousand dollars, Ill run through it in one day
I'm a Glo Boy I be shining from my wrist to my gold teeth
And you better be talking money when you approach me
I been balling so damn hard I swear I think that I'm Kobe
You say I ain't getting money pussy boy you don't know me
