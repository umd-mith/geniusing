And tell your niggas
“Wake up, wake up, wake up, we can’t sleep too long,”
Way too long
Ain’t no TLC, boy, we can’t creep too long
Creep too long
We finna put you on some shit though
Shit though
THEMpeople make you wanna get low
But tell em
“Wake up, wake up, wake up, we can’t sleep too long"
Wake up, wake up
We got bread to break up, we can’t be too long
Can’t sleep too long
We finna put you on some shit though
THEMpeople make you wanna get low
(Get low)
Brush you teeth after the wake and bake
Drink more water, watch your fake intake
Don’t ever be scare to make mistakes, thats how you grow
And avoidin’ the same mistakes you made is how you know
You movin’ forward, its bout progressin’, I’m learnin’ lessons
Most of this shit is really perception, its no perspective
Most of my niggas is the exception, the water keep us reflective
Thats why I gotta repeat it, pearls of wisdom repeated
I’m chiefin’ with people that I can trust, rolling, burning,  ’til they depleted
Leave the ashes its dust
They sayin’ cash is a must, I beg to differ
I take the little dipper, as long as the ladle full
I wanted to be an actor but I couldn’t play the fool at all
Miseducated, could give a fuck about no school of thought, if you hate it
Food for thought, regurgitatin’ what they played it for me
Cookin’ faded, look what we created, then we catered for free
And tell your niggas
“Wake up, wake up, wake up, we can’t sleep too long,”
Way too long
Ain’t no TLC, boy, we can’t creep too long
Creep too long
We finna put you on some shit though
Shit though
THEMpeople make you wanna get low
But tell em
“Wake up, wake up, wake up, we can’t sleep too long"
Wake up, wake up
We got bread to break up, we can’t be too long
Can’t sleep too long
We finna put you on some shit though
THEMpeople make you wanna get low
(Get low)
Wake up, woke up to another 24
Some my brothers still in slumber, thank the lord
We was just dreamin’ about makin’ it easier
The little things in life, you know the tedious
Well oh he was teachin’ us, he workin’ while the goonies hate
Real nigga in the same thing too they straight
I can’t complain I was able when they was painin
Ain’t had cable but had a radio and a brain
Put two and two together in the ghetto
And thats how I came up off my hoover thought a lil not
Mick even brought the water, I swear its a fuckin’ potluck
Give us this day our daily bread and thats more than a dollar bill
Had to cope with a lot of bull but ain't fold cuz I’m smart again
Look, they no longer recognize you
You once did a show iced tonic and didn’t impress anybody
Now look at you, you acquire, your pussy rate has sky-rocketed
You came a long way since high school, you stepped out of your comfort zone
I think I used to sleep so long, cause I ain't ever want to stop dreamin'
Count my blessings like sheep, this real life just won’t let me be
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, it’s time to wake up my niggas
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, it’s time to wake up, right now
I think I used to try too hard, cause now everything comes easy
Open your eyes and trust yourself, and let the world see who you are
Its all yours
Its all yours
Its all yours
