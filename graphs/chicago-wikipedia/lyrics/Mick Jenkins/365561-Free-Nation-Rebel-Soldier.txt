Start the steamer
We steaming the marijuana
Like spark plugs for the conversation
Free Nation Rebels a compilation of real niggas
Field niggas, don't you let us off the chain
Cause we plotting,
I'm just writing
Fingers bleeding like I'm picking cotton
Fresh jazz, but I spit it rotten
Put vendettas in the letters for the mail
But I'm picking Stockton
Fuck your stocks, I'm a bigger option
Fuck your couch, you a opp
Get the picture, we don't do the cropping
Clean floor, we don't do no mopping
AllSaints is the brand of the scarf
Got caught up with a case
Nigga handcuffed with a narc
I ain't never preaching above you
Just telling you about the struggle
Cause the flash ain't never going to bring the light to the dark
It's all good
Like the kush I been puffing with this ginger ale
This world cold but it's nothing if you been in hell
I tell them patience isn't hard when you been in jail
Ready for the war, nigga, Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell
Since they whooped Emmett Till shit done been real
Billy with the wood club and sword with the pencil
Use a stencil
And probably still couldn't trace Sean
Puffing up pepper spray
And they say I'm spitting mace
Back in '96
When Patti Mayonnaise was a bad bitch
and
Hip hop was still full of classics
Not a bunch of trees
Just a bunch of truth and the fruit be the leaves
Nigga let me see your roots
Homie stay grounded
Don't let them flies turn your hopes into hurt
How you talk shit, you never taste it?
I see through the lies like I had Lasik
I'm never basic
Face it
You niggas faking
You need a face lift
I see the makeup, the whips, chains, and the bracelets
And that don't mean a damn thing to me
No that don't mean a damn thing to Free
You talking truth you better bring the trees
You talking truth you better bring the trees
You better get to know me
I move in silence like I'm with Shinobi
You want to wrestle with these words then I'm Mick Foley
This Trees and Truths but I've been killing them since Killing Them Softly
