This shit sound like days of our lives
Freenation out here paying our tithes
save mula give em' ten percent
Thats too fuckin much. Thats like window tint
Shouts to Such n Such. [Unh]
Sauk Trail
Cheifin on the back porch, grillin each other
Conversation was penicillin, niggas healin each, other thats how the fam do
Free Nation Rebel Soldier
Pant like a black panther
the standards are Huey Newton or Bobby Seale
Cam Newton, or Issac Newton
You'll prolly feel
The apple off yo forehead
Don't chalk it up to gravity
I'm dropping knowledge actually
I'm dropping college actually
I left without my credits give me credit nigga
My credentials with this pencil put you on your toes, put my soul on instrumentals
A foot fetish nigga
If you dont you couldn't hide in 50 camos
I'm wit a chick you couldn't hump wit 50 camel backs
Sick as 50 camel packs of cigarettes
Don't give me lip unless its camel toe
Nights like we in Camelot
You could call him Lancelot how I swing Excalibur at ignorance
Knights of the round table
Nice wit profound fables
Turn around on dime if its a buck on her mind i could give a fuck if she fine
Give me nickles and quarters
We ain't building foundations fickle I'm spittin that mortar
Snappin' ladders like peanut brittle the distance is shorter
Its like ripples on water you could catch the wave like Lake Michigan hittin' Wisconsin
Winters cold but it's warm when Jackson's right next yo Johnson
They see that and they bring the action all over your Bronson Bratwurst
I be like negro please no matter how you see it rap just like the negro leagues
I'm talking tress and speaking truths
For the free cause that's all my peoples know. That's the only way to go.
And they ain't got a Muthafuckin' clue when the world gone end so starting from the bottom I'mma stack my ends swear to god that I'll never lose my soul for no Benz
negro please We gone play this negro league till we bleed till the fleas eat my muthafuckin' knees ill be running wit my dogs
And they ain't got a muthafuckin' clue when the world blow if the ground start to shake you can bet I'm out the door when a blunt and prayer for the fam fuck a ho.
For the free cause thats all my peoples know. For the free cause thats all my peoples know. For the free cause thats all my peoples know
