Ridin' around off this ginger ale
Peep the herbal essence in the papers, vapors
On fire if you couldn't tell
But trust me,
I ain't checkin' for no Jezebels or Delilahs
Lot of niggas screaming that they real
Perception is a mothafuckin' pill, you a liar
I been rocking boats since Aaliyah
Trying to take it higher with these notes like Mariah
Fuck with me, your connect ain't got it for the Free
Start the elevation, I can't keep it lowkey
OG, finna' wake these niggas up, ain't been getting no sleep
Tryin' to bring him more sheep, I'm like little Bo Peep
Got a young man trying to move through the city like a black Tom Thibodeau
Like Stallone, you can fight it all you want
But we still gonna be expendable, these niggas don't listen, no
I was always told that you never really know what you got 'til it's gone
Cancer caught my granny 'fore I got a chance to check up what the fuck was I on? (the fuck was I on?)
I was playing checkers, this is chess
Never put your faith into a check
Got to play the hand that you was dealt
There's only four aces in a deck, motherfucker, I've been
Riding around off this ginger ale
Mama wouldn't like the way I smell right now
Realest nigga out; can't you tell?
Drink this water, tell me how you feel right now
Riding around off this ginger ale
Praying every day that I don't fail right now
Healing niggas; how can't you tell?
Drink this water, tell me how you feel right now
