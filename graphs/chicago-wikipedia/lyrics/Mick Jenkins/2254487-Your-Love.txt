[Hook 1]
Had to hold it down for the love
She the type of woman make you wanna leave the drugs
(Had to hold it down!)
Not the type of nigga that’ll really do the club
Plenty water, double cup, baby, let me know what’s up
Oh… we could have a dream
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Have a dream, dream, dream
Fall in love, love, love
I want to love you
I want to love you (You know I need your love)
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want to love you
I want to love you (You know I need your love)
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Pardon me for standing in your sunshine, lady
Let me parlay with you for the one time, lady
I can promise it'd be a fun time
I ain't try'na run game, or hit you with a sublime, lady
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want to love you
5'3" with the Crown Royal skin-tone
Plus she brought her own water
Man, she been on
Pearled the joints, she hit me with a couple pearls of wisdom
Now it’s on, had me open like a flip-phone
Flip-mode, every single night it's bussin'
We be learnin' till we leanin' like we off the Robitussin
Keep the pace slow
Movin' with the tempo, know you feel it when the bass low
Waitin' on the break down
I don’t need a peso
Did it for the low-low, girl, the free is what I’m based on
Come and build with me
We could be a couple Masons
No insurance to the growth
Just state farm
Hold on, lady, stay calm
We can have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Have a dream, dream, dream
Fall in love, love, love
I want to love you
I want to love you (You know I need your love)
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want to love you
I want to love you (You know I need your love)
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Had to hold it down for the love
She the type of woman make you wanna leave the drugs
(You know I need your love)
Not the type of nigga that'll really do the club
Plenty water, double cup, baby let me know what’s up
You know I need your love
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
I want to love you
I want to love you (You know I need you right now)
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want to love you
I want to love you
