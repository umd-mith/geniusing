Wolves in disguise
How you supposed to see 'em with the wool in your eyes?
Sheep to the radio, we fooled and surprised
They ain’t never loved me, it's bullshit and lies
But I’m Austin Powers, I remember gold
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you know, tell me what you know
(All of this shit is perception)
Tell me what you see, tell me what you see
Tell me what you know
(All of this shit is perception)
Back down, we been up longer
Winter came, so you know I had to put the Mac down
Get my cuff on like a new suit
6'5", young Bruce Bruce
Pack strong, that's Bruce Banner off the vegitary
With the couscous,
black clouds
Bring the rain down on the new cool
Like it ain't shit, monsoon when we brainstorm, that's the same shit
Muthafucka, this is art trap, you can see the verses like I'm paintin' shit
With some paintballs, shots sound like a Goose Goose
Willy Wonka, I got no cellings, if I do, I finna need a new roof, fuck a limitation
Regardless I was gonna be in here, fuck an invitation, what's a golden ticket?
Tell these niggas I don't need the juice, show these niggas how I got the stripes
Now they look at me like I'm Beetle Juice with a zebra cape
Court vision can't you see the floor?
I'mma  lead the break in monotony
Treat the game like Monopoly, it's no snake shit
Just cottonmouth from the botany, I mean obviously we get it
It's obvious that this shit a circus
I'm obviously flee wit it, they'll take the world, they'll break the world
Then look at us like we did it, I'm...
Puffin' on the flower, pull it through your nose
But I’m Austin Powers, I remember gold
[Bridge: TheMIND]
How do you see the world?
Views from the fifth dimension
They slip intentions in every lie
I've seen the promise, persons with wings that will never fly
They called us crabs in barrels
Carried us to our peril, we say we don't belong here
Why, why, why, why
