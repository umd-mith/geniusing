Shorty told me that she do not do the fakes
Same bitch got weave
My nigga mow the lawn it's too many snakes
That's the same shit that got Eve
What? You ain't never seen a nigga on a horse?
You ain't seen Chief Keef's new Porsche?
Naw, you ain't seen shit yet,
better not forget that spit it like I chain smoke Newports
All the little niggas got guns now
And they carry them to the fucking beat
All these little girls give it up now
Shame, I could see the cherry stems in the fucking street
Niggas aim too high to leave the lows
Niggas hang too high to see the lows
Niggas ain't-- niggas ain't really listening let me break it down for you
Just before you forgot about him, overlooked or started doubting
I doused it with the flow and started talking all this water shit
It's like I started drowning
In  truth,
the thought is pounding
I started counting the loopholes in they stories that they tell us
Every evening at like 10 when Judy Hsu is on yo TV tellin'
Songs in the key of life, you was on yo Stevie
I pray it's never too preachy but I'm preaching
Losing hella blood these fuck niggas leeching
Why you reaching? I'm like 6'5"
Stop it
We are not on the same plateau
Chateau de Chenonceau
You just throwing shade in my shadow
Ginger ale in my Chalice
I never been champagne shallow
I'd  never run from a battle I'd rather hang from the gallows
For I let a stray bullet catch a nigga on the 9
Trey 8 pulling 0-9; Kwame Brown; if a nigga act foul then we put em on the line
It's a shame that's the game on these young niggas minds like
I'ma get all this money
I'ma buy all this shit
I'ma fuck so many hoes
Nigga, I'ma fuck yo bitch
I'm just with my niggas
I'ma get all this money
I'ma buy all this shit
I'ma fuck so many hoes
Nigga, I'ma fuck yo bitch
I'm just wit my niggas hanging
Hanging
I'm just with my niggas hanging
Hanging
Hanging on for dear life
For the love of the money
Hanging on for dear life
Don't that shit sound funny?
Hanging on for dear life
For the love of the gold
Hanging on for dear life
Don't that shit feel cold?
I'ma get all this money
I'ma buy all this shit
I'ma fuck so many hoes
Nigga, I'ma fuck yo bitch
I'm just with my niggas
I'ma get all this money
I'ma buy all this shit
I'ma fuck so many hoes
Nigga, I'ma fuck yo bitch
