Calm down, nigga, this golden
Go and take a hit of these roses
Go and get a sip of this water
Let your seat back, relax, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable, get comfortable

Calm down, nigga, this golden
Go and take a hit of these roses
Go and get a sip of this water
Let your seat back, relax, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable, get comfortable
Got your joint, it's in rotation, check the syncopation
Deep off in these waters, never needing no flotation
Devices,
on this humble pie by the slices
Give it to 'em free, cause it's priceless
This your invitation, I'ma even welcome imitations
Smoking mirrors, I've been spitting rocks and ventilation
So, breathe motherfucker, just breathe
Tank tops can't hang, I ain't never even gang bang
Nigga just hang with the wrong folks
Got a little older, got a little wiser, put the reggie down that's the wrong smoke
Been around the world enough, to know that you will never get rich,
if you the wrong broke
Can't live life through a song quote, man
I've been trying to show y'all me
I ain't been accepting nobody's gas and still got drive, nigga still on E
Nigga still gon' lie, and I still on G, tell your girlfriend not to feel on me
And usually we would have a whole bunch of ginger ale, but lately I'm been in these waters, like a slow bro
So, pardon my manners, this is more street etiquette
Know that I ain't going nowhere, if you believe otherwise, then you niggas better peep rhetoric
[Verse 2: NoName]
You ain't even gotta ask me, I'm classy
Pina colada with a blue Laffy Taffy
I’m rapping to save a life, get that Apache
Indian remy on a scalp coming out
Nigga just chilling on the couch in a blouse like Dave Chappelle
be that nigga for life
I drip drip on the haters for real
More smoke and mirrors inside of the matchbox
images looking like mascots
My whole team got the city on the rise
And making the sun jealous
we dreaming new dimensions
We don't need no ice
I just wanna see your hands in the air and the fans in the stands and my name hella bright
"Noname on the comeup"
Telefone never coming out, what's the hold up?
Where you been at? Where the print at?
We just wanna hear the truth and the music
Before the sun goes down and the meaning of life becomes obsolete
Calm down, nigga, this golden
Go and take a hit of these roses
Go and get a sip of this water
Let your seat back, relax, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable, get comfortable

Calm down, nigga, this golden
Go and take a hit of these roses
Go and get a sip of this water
Let your seat back, relax, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable, get comfortable
We been in here, we ain't going nowhere
And we do it for the Free, you know that
Just vibe, just vibe, just vibe
