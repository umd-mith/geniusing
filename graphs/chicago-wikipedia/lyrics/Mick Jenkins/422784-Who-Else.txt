Tell me who else do you know
Know that you ain't felt it like this in a long time
Take yo shoes off at the door
And the flow stay clean for a long time, long time
Southside nigga from the go
So many times in the wrong place at the wrong time
Double cup the water sip slow
Double cup the water sip slow
Tell me who else do you know
Know that you ain't heard it like this in a long time
Take yo shoes off at the door
And the flow stay clean for a long time, long time
Southside nigga from the go
So many times in the wrong place at the wrong time
Double cup the water sip slow
Double cup the water sip slow
Tell me who else do you know
Tell me who else do you know
Know that you ain't heard it like this
Know that you ain't heard it like this
Know that you ain't heard it like this
I ain't never been a loner
Although I feel like Jonah in the ocean
Conversations with the big fish
Danny Ocean what a gamble they could miss this I pray that you don't
An olive branch symbolized that the waters  had stopped
Like if you got trees and truths before the waters had dropped
I know you saw signs, Black Mel Gibson with the passion
I been gifted with the rapping
niggas tripping I been trapping
Gotta move so many keys to unlock the boxes we trapped in
We been ready to take off for like 400 years now
But we're blinded through our ears now
Plus it's all smoke n mirrors now
In conversation I Piers Morgan my peers now
Just to keep it authentic,
and often it's a shadow of Paul Pierce how
Well we'll play for the green
All the while Never noticing the changing of scene
Like I was gone leave this bitch, but if y'all gone roll up I might as well stay for the green
So much weeping you'll be giving birth to willows in this shark tale
So much weighing on his mind every bar like a barbel
Every crack in his voice got coke from the cartel
Take your shoes off at the door don't disrespect flow stay clean for a long time long time
Sip on this country time fam I been squeezing my lemons
Squeegee my windows I’m just trying see it clearly
Spit it in braille so I know you feel me
The shit is bumping like cucumbers
I brought the reign for a new thunder
