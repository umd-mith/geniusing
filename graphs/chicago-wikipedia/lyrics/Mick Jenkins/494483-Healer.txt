My piss ain't never been so clear
My pockets never been so empty
My heart ain't never been this full
But my stomach is not so my nigga don't tempt me
I'm hungry,
I'm thirsty, I'm tired, I'm smoking,
it often seems
This life that we want is only lost in dreams
Am I getting lost in the thought of myself trying wake niggas up like a coffee bean?
She called my vices
We was at Starbucks getting lost in these caramel apple spices
Conversation all but priceless, topics ranged from the innermost thoughts to all the trifling shit on Worldstar
And other solar systems, and other planets of people, and how close our worlds are
And how she don't ever really smoke but how nice my pearls are
You feel like water baby
You heal my body, baby
You soothe my aching soul
This feel like water baby
This soothes my aching soul
You feel like water baby
You heal my body, baby
You soothe my aching soul
This feel like water baby
This soothes my aching soul
Cause life got a nigga stressed out
It ain't all just about rap no more
My name just like my phone and it buzz so much I don't even text back no more
I done sold so many clothes I don't even gotta pack no more
Just throw it all in one bag
Break it down and roll it all in one joint, take a puff and blow it all in one drag
We gone with the wind,
out in Montreal somewhere where your French don't gotta be excused
French inhales with some friends with my quality of life on the fringe, I just see it as a muse
Everybody hurts, I just deal with the abuse,
Passion of Christ with my pen to the pad
Your passion for life will exceed the paper just to sip of the holiest water he has
You feel like water baby
You heal my body, baby
You soothe my aching soul
This feel like water baby
This soothes my aching soul
You feel like water baby
You heal my body, baby
You soothe my aching soul
This feel like water baby
This soothes my aching soul
[Verse 3: Jean Deaux]
Call him Confucius, lucid inside my mind
Truth is within his eyes never told me a lie
But hold me up to the sky, and ring me out till I'm dry
Never felt so alive, call you when I might dive
Out the window floor 35
Tell me you not surprised
Open your mouth and let me fall into your solar plexus
I want to wash over your soul until you get the message
I wanna follow you straight home so you can finish stressin'
When you need fixing, give me 30 seconds
I’ll cleanse you out until you au corant
Cause when I stumble into you I knew that it was God
I know that
You feel like water baby
You heal my body, baby
You soothe my aching soul
This feel like water baby
This soothes my aching soul
You feel like water baby
You heal my body, baby
You soothe my aching soul
This feel like water baby
This soothes my aching soul
