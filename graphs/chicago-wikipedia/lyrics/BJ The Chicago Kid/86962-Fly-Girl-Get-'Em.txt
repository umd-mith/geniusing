I see you trying to diguise that uh, potential
I see you trying to downplay all that sexiness
I see you, haha, ah
She put her hair up in a ponytail
No make-up on her face
A wrinkled t-shirt and some jogging pants
Her Air Max, she never lace
And as she open her door
And says "hello" to the world
No, she's not insecure
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
And still fly-er than them other girls
And I just say "fly girl get 'em"
Go ahead, assassinate 'em
I just yell "fly girl get 'em"
Go ahead and make your way
Yeah, she's the queen of all the simple things
The simple things in life
But yet, she'll work harder
Than you've ever seen for her kid
The perfect kind of wife
So when she open her door
Baby, baby, baby, hah
And says "hello" to the world
No, she's not insecure, oh
But still fly-er than them other girls
But I just yell "fly girl get 'em"
Go ahead, assassinate 'em
I just say "fly girl get 'em
Get 'em, get 'em"
Go ahead and make your way
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Trying to act like them toes ain't pretty
I like that smile, don't kill me, I see you
