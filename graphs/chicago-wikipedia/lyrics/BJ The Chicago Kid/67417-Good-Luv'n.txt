Just her face'll make you wanna have a taste
Or just her smile'll drive you crazy for a while
Then I told her, "There's nothing wrong with me loving you
Baby, no no no, no no na na"
And giving yourself to me could never be wrong
If the love is true aw baby, aw
[Hook]
So let's do it in the morning
Sweet breeze in the summertime
Feelin' your sweet face
All laid up next to mine
Good lovin' in the midnight
Of course her waist line reminds me of this bass line
And if you went back in time she still would be fine
Even if this was 1959
Oh there's nothing wrong with me loving you, yeah
