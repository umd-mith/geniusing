[Intro: Samples & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Alright y'all
I want y'all to put your hands together
And to bring on the brothers that bound to lay more dips in your hips
More glide in your stride
And if you don't think it's next you got the wrong damn address
Fuck your love, motherfuck your love
That's what Sir John say
You can laugh all you want but he's right as hell
Cupid's ain't around these days
I've heard many stories about how he made people all around the world fall in love
Well I got a call just the other day
Telling me where Cupid was
[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Cupid's too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know, I'm sure
Boys and girls
Love ain't dead
Stupid I'm the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
Cause love's still alive
I said, Love ain't dead
Stupid I'm the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
Cause love's still alive
The responsibility lies on me
Since Cupid ain't around
And when y'all really feeling like you're falling in love
When my music put's you right on down
And everybody (I see)
And I know (I know)
Some people really think they in love
But now without a love song
Something's gone way wrong
Cupid's too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know I'm sure
Boys and girls
Love ain't dead
Stupid I'm the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
Cause love's goodbye
I said, Love ain't dead
Stupid I'm the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
Cause love's goodbye
Love ain't dead
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
As I play out the Commodores, my faith destroyed
My heart don't work, I'm unemployed
The feeling is void, don't know what I need
Some pussy, some paper, some counseling
Maybe some Henny, some weed
I'm looking for you, I'm checking for her
I'm parking lot pimpin', I'm honking at women, I'm all on the curb
Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump my brake, pump my brake
Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, don't walk away, walk away
I'm fishing for compliments
This is a fairy tale, I know you very well
Fuck all your promises, I know what time it is
I'm just a realist, I am the realest
Reality is fatality cursed on the future for family, wife and some kids
I'm looking for you, I'm checking for her
I'm parking lot pimpin', I'm honking at women, I'm all on the curb
Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump your brake, pump your brake
Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, don't walk away, walk away
[Skit]
Might sound weird
But a great night, you in a real relationship, you understand what I'm saying
A great night with somebody you love, is difficult
Somebody you like is always good
Like is wonderful
You come home with some juice, with the woman you like:
"Can I have some juice?"
"Gimme that juice, pour juice all over me"
Pour that juice all over that sexy body"
Let you be together three years and shit
"Can I have some juice?"
Bitch, why you want my juice?
You know I'm dehydrated
I try to come home and shit
Tryin' to get some juice you want my juice...
