Start stacking yo money stop spending that shit on that Louis and Gucci

These haters be yapping and bluffing
Acting the toughest but they can not fool me

Shout out to my jeweler I'm sliding on ice but I ain't playing hockey

I stay with that glocky
Be flashy and cocky
Flow colder then hockey

And all of my shooters gone blow like grenades
We stay with them guns
And shine line the sun
If you can't stand the heat you gone die in the shade
From the the PC so shout out to my jets
2820 south cal you met
Straight off the low end
And when I start flowing you know Ima go in like nothing but net
Was up in the trap like i was caught in a net
Waiting on the 1st of the month for them checks
My mom was a victim
Cocaine in her system sometimes It felt like my OG was possessed
Bad up in school acting a fool report card full of F's
As I grew older I got a little wiser
Opened my eyes and realized that I'm blessed
Put me on a track and I bet I catch wreck
Just bring bread and that beat ima put it to rest
Make sure when you come that you coming correct
You gone show love or gone show me respect
Anything less I'm uping that tech
It got one In the neck
You'll get one in ya neck

With niggas who hustle moving weight like a sumo
Swag on the honeys they loving it

Long 30 clip and it's filled up with hollows
