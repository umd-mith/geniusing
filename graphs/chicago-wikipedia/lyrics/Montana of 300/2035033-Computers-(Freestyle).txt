[Verse 1: $avage]
You got all these social media accounts nigga
Behind computers, all you do is run your mouth nigga
Don't make me pull up with some shooters at your house nigga
Like what’s all that shit you talking bout nigga!
If I don't got it, pockets hurting, I'm a rob a person
And niggas said they tryna get me
But bitch I'm always in the hood like I'm Kenny
Man free my Uncle out the you know, every verse for you
If rap don't work and work don't move it's back to murking dudes
Can't fuck with niggas, lot of niggas fu
Shout out FGE, them my dudes
He think he 2pac with the juice, until he Bishop on the roof
Man niggas bitches, Twitter talking, I ain't with the talking
They with they bitches pillow talking, all them niggas frauding
Say he gon catch me out in traffic, caught that nigga walking
Rolled down the window with extendos pistols get to sparking
Don't use emojis, niggas know me, you got poles then show me
But niggas police, run up on me smoke em like some OG
My OG told me, "Niggas phony, watch them like a rollie"
Might roll up on him, blow and if he pussy I'm a show him
Straight up exposing, don't do talking, I shoot like the Office
They gon chalk em, toss the burner just another murder
And I'm headed to your block
bitch
Me and my niggas on that mob shit
And you know Juno on some hot shit
Glocks spit, hit his noodles get the chopsticks
And money cheese bought a brand new .45
He had already ran through like 45
Mob
[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
A lot of niggas acting hard, on these computers
Hate that this gangster got bars like Larry Hoover
And everything I touch get ripped, like Freddy Krueger
If I pursue you, click clack booya, we sing hallelujah
The clip threw up in my ruger, same size of a ruler
Flex like Lex Luger with my shooters,
pockets fat like Buddha
Got racks like Hooters,
but as soon as rappers act like Luda
Get smoked like hookah, ice like coolers I feel like a Jeweler
You niggas bitches boy you fugazee
blow yo top off boy you faker than a toupee
These niggas pussy watch my rachet pop that coochie
Clip like a preview then I show them like a movie
go out the sunroof with that Uzi
Dark nights like Batman let my gat blam now you Two Face
Skateoff like Lupe, leave your niggas blue like Tookie
I ball like 2K but be strapped like Call of Duty
I'm bout the action, ain't no acting this is not rehearsal
Ain't with the lacking, bitch that rachet hug me like a girdle
Two straps like Urkel
I'm not verbal
killers in my circle
Montana always rock bandanas like a Ninja Turtle
When I send shells, no Donatello you get smoked like purple
Go in like curfew
pop
and murk you,
I'm gon white T-shirt you
I'm sonning niggas like I birth you, my shit just too fertile
I hop on tracks and get shit jumping like a fucking hurdle
I'm fly as shit yes I am sick, I got the Flu
I got that bag, I got that swag, I got that juice
Yo bitch feeling me like a masseuse
She wanna give a nigga neck just like a noose
I ain't fu, gun cases, I caught two
This what I do, pull up shooting like I hoop
Touch every nigga in your circle, Duck Duck Goose
And even God knows I'm a killer on the loose
Two shots in your leg homie, I'm a make you beg homie
Uh uh don't be scared homie, two shots hit your dreads homie
Ten more to your head homie, bro like "Yo, he dead Tony!"
I'm just making sure I reunite him with his dead homie
I was the plug
my clientele they used to spend
Drug trafficking
I got that work out like a gym
I hope God forgives me for my sins
(Stupid Bitch!) Me and Jesus look like twins!
Same color skin,
I'm just inked up like a pen
When I pull up you gonna catch shots just like a rim
He think he Pac above the rim, so I did his ass like Birdie at the end
I just bought a Glock with all the perks
I just got 5000 for a verse
Like hold that cash and got that strap just like a purse
I be counting mula like a clerk
And counting blessings although I feel like I'm cursed
My choppers used to sing just like Lil Vert
Get ready for fire in the church
