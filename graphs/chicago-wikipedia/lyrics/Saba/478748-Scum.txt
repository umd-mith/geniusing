They call us scum, from the city slums and
They all think we idiot, like we
They call us scum, from the city slums and
They all think we idiot, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, cheap drinks
Bible, we pray
Kill in Jesus name, kill people for a Jesus chain
For a fortune we'll change,
can't afford to eat with change
Our tummy growlin', they money pilin', my mommy poutin'
Some of them doubtin', I don't
They closed the school that you went to
And told you that it's rent due, left potholes where you carpool
And caca on that carpet
I don't, there's no politics in my home
Cause they call us scum, from the city slums
And they all think we idiot, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, Chief Keef
Bible, we pray
But kill in GD name, and get judge by our GPA
Shit if we don't like the same food, how they expect us to eat the same?
Burnin' bridges to earn a livin'
Raise your blood pressure, no tourniquet
But expect you can turn the cheek
Major turn of events when you turn eighteen
They kicked you out of your middle school, said your work was pitiful
Mama's loan didn't get approved
So you got a gun, lookin' just like them
Cause whether cap and gown or cappin' down ya called scum
Why they call us scum, from the city slums why
They all think we idiots, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, cheap drinks
Bible, we pray
[Outro]
Feelin' regal in my old school regal
Listenin' to Segal with a couple of my amigos
They been speakin' about the evils of the Windy Coast
That's too many for me to mention, so hear a dose
Know a dab will do ya too much
Sab' will school ya not even gasin' him up
Each track hit harder than a Mack or a truck
Change seats, change cuts, this upholstery  too much for a degenerate
[?]
Take the game cause the player ain't do it
Every time I hit the scene they say dark be the trend
You see people where I be seein' my twin
Too many losses got me focused on wins
Chuuch!
