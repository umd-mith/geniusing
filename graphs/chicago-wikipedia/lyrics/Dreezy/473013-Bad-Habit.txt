Somebody tell me what it feel like
I never touched it I never had it
I saw it once but I couldn't grab it
Took my heart then he fuckin stabbed it
Somebody tell me what it feel like
I swear to god I thought it was real
The worst pain is falling in love with a nigga that dont even feel the way that you feel
I was like a feign he was like a drug
We was having sex threw away the glove
To be honest when push come to shove
I think I found everything except love
The last nigga said he die for me
The last nigga said he ride for me
The last nigga was the last nigga that I ever trusted cause guess what he lied to me
And last time was the last time thats what I said last time
Until I call that nigga phone at 2 a.m.and told him I wanna do it for the last time
And of course he was with it
So yea you know I payed a visit
And on my neck I felt his kisses
Fuck it it ain't nobody else business
I dont know that to feel its
Taking over my mind taking over my body
Dont know how to heal it
Cause I keep on coming back
Its like I gotta bad habit
Yea Yea...
Its like I gotta bad habit
Is it really that easy for you to leave me
Have me fall for you then deceive me
Lied to me like you need space
Whole time you was in another bitch face
Who was there, who was there for you
You couldn't breath I was air for you
When I needed you baby where was you
I created a monster now im scared of you
I love you but I hate you
I just wanted the perfect picture to paint you
