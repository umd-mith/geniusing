[Hook]
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see, if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin, ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to fuck you up
It's like, ("Uh, ah!")
Muthafucka can't fight the feelin', the way I'mma fuck him
Have an orgasm and before the morgue has him killed him as if a four-five bucked him
Talk about a man being scared
I done killed him, he dead in his tomb, still shakin’
Hit him in his body, and his head
Now he found up in heaven, with the wound still achin'
I wonder, if his voice still breakin'
Better be cause I readily
Hit him with gats and styles, that's heavily
Armed and dangerous and deadly
Them ahead of me receive two holes, like a letter ‘B’
Better you instead of me
Break our peace, can increase your chances
To delete your advances
If it’s faint, I can paint this piece on canvas
With a paint brush that a nigga can't trust
Like a god, so I can't rush, won't crush
If you ever heard about a crew that can't bust, then muthafucka it ain't us,
don’t touch
A mic or a gun, if you ain't gonna use it, do it
Cause no matter who it -
Is, K-Town and Westside’ll leave a bitch, sheddin’ tears
The young kill everyday, the old itchin’ to kill, ‘cause they ain't left nigga, dead in years
Shoot him dead in his (head),
This style of flow, is a verbal Calico, make a chest ripple
They get a call from the sky, if they all don’t die, better leave the rest crippled
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin, ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to, fuck you up
Life is priceless, if you try to take mine, leavin’ muthafuckaz cold, as a crisis
With a technique as old as Isis, and mics as my control devices
Or, do I gotta get off into some nigga shit? Show the bigger dick , with a thicker clique
That'd be hazardous, if I let the trigger click,
you don’t benefit, if a nigga get
Off on the rage, even if it’s just a little bit, so go’on with the riddle shit
If you got something to stress, then get it off your chest, and we can take it to the middle, bitch and go on
Get it on, and I bet you that the outcome, is that I'm leavin’ niggas outdone, cut up
Bullets hard to see a muthafucka outrun, just because he let his mouth run, shut up
And sit back if you know what's good for you, I can still overthrow you
I don’t give a fuck about the fact, that the hood know you, don’t make a nigga have to show you
That I’mma die, before I let you make an ass of me, snap as if you took a blast at me, and cause tragedy
That was how it was, that was how it is, and that's the way it has to be,
(always ever, all day, death be...)
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin, ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to, fuck you up
Sit back and let the shit I say marinate, I pull the stage curtain back
Like Norman Bates, performin’ hate, smokin’ on some reefer, preparin’ fate
It's a constant scuffle for us, White boys with the shit, hittin’ licks in the hustle for us, my nigga
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin, ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to, fuck you up
