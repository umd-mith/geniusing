[Intro: Chris Brown]
I don’t see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can’t even get in
Hahaha
l'ego!
[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah
That shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in 10 years, in two days
Ladies love me; I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari
[Hook: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil nigga, bigger than gorilla
Cause I’m killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain’t really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I’m done
Now let a track go past like this and Twista not fuck with it
Y’all done lost your mind
I could do any rhythm and any pattern that I wanna do, the harder that it go
You could see blood spilling out from a body right in front of you, and I'ma get the dough
Now the way I be shinin' be havin' everybody lookin' at me
I do a murder when I'm trigger happy (like)
'Cause I'm a kedavers when I'm attackin' the beat I'm a scholar
cause I'm a personification of God
I could spit a rhythm to a bitch and get her pussy wetter
Nine millimeter and spillin' millions of milliliters of life out a nigga if he talk shit
Go get your momma to bring a thermometer, my temperatures hot
Think Twista could kill em on a track with Busta, Breezy and Weezy?
Easy!
[Hook: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker
Man, fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doin’?
I’m Lil Tunechi,
I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don’t eat sushi,
I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution,
no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater,
got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
Whats poppin’ slime? Nothin’ five,
and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive,
these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight,
bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right,
and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice
and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared cause I’m too wild,
been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I’m so Young Money,
if you got eyes look at me now, bitch
[Hook: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker
[Outro: Chris Brown]
Okay, okay
Is that right?
I’m fresher than a motherfucker
