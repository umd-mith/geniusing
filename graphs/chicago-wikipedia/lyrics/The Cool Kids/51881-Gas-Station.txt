So certified USDA
Brand dude from PA,
man this UGK
And I'm rockin my Ray Bans mirror lens tinted up
Servin these boys so place your orders out, send em up
Blue plate special with the blue paint drippin
Carolina blue J's on my feet
and I ain't trippin
Dippin one deep,
fuck it two, matter fact quatro
Me, Chuck, Mikey and one seat left out, four
Sweet James Jones, grippin sweet grain holmes
It's a bumpy ride ahead so you best to hang on
We kamikaze style and we 'bout to get it gungho
84 Biarritz on 84, the trunk is hung low
Fifth wheel dragging got the boppers in my sight
I bust a u-y at the intersection catch em at the light
Yo what's cracking for tonight? Cause if you ain't got a plan
I got a man and we could hook up something tight
Just make a right into the gas station
I got my hands full, the Full Force, Force MD's
Troop's in the tape player,
Through 6 grade, tape was "All Eyez On Me"
Nas used that same beat when he spit "Street Dreams"
My mom drove a Corsica, we was in the back seat
Looking out the window imagination real big dreams
I set a new standard for who felt like me
Showing you the big picture the complete HD
DVR rewind it back you wouldn't believe
Said I bring that old thing back and they couldn't believe it
The air fare's way more for a trip to Ibiza
The petrol is 5 bucks, I can't believe it
What the fuck is the deal, we too dependent on that barrel
Its the way of the world, keep shifting its gears man
Throw it reverse for a shorty with the works
Write my number on some paper then throw it in her purse
As I ride by first things first
9 times out of the 10 that cool shit usually works
I'm growing money trees in my front yard
Let me water my lawn, I make it look so easy it hurts
Let me get my other dollar back, know I had change
Cause the chicken wrap don't cost more than I gave fool
Man, fuck it you can keep that buck
And all my niggas in the Range Roves just keep trucking
selling suede hats
In the rain won't work but one try won't hurt me
Lucky number 10s and a Rondo jersey
