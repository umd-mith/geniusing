This for all y'all
Roll call
If you're live then state your name
It's like bust that (bust that), who's that (who was that)?
It's Mike Rocks, take a look up top
I had the Iceberg sweaters and the jeans back in '01
Daffy Duck running on the stomach of that sweater
Chicago getter,
inside all leather
Point a live nigga out if you know one
Talking about a shopping spree, damn, now we on one
I'm just kidding, ain't gonna be no bag-getting
Casino-ass niggas always throw their chips in
Throw it in the bag, like the bag that the chips in
Bag after bag of that cabbage
we twisting
Thinking about our existence
and sticking to the mission
You could get a lot off top
Or you could get that pot that you piss in
Depends if you was listening
We've been to Michigan Ave
with bag handles on hand
And sandals on sand ain't a better match
Put 20 on the game, man
that's plenty in the tank
But never scratch, let me bet 'em back
It's Charles Chop and it this shit don't stop
The governor, the mayor, the president, the rest of them
I'm dressed in Guess jeans, pocket buzzing text messages
Left hand roll it,
pass me the lighter
Right hand jab job to your face like we're fighting
Uppercutting niggas up, feeling tougher than a leather seat
To the ground like I threw you down from a couple stories
Don't drop it, don't lock my door
I got the key in the ignition, we at the corner store kicking it
This is it, nigga this that shit
Them live rap rhymes that'll stick to your ribs, kid
Not that fake soy meat boneless McRibs
Bite this homie, that's bad for your wellness
Health insurance coverage couldn't cover regardless
You looking like us and we ain't even get started!
That's why we don't believe you
Fuck it man, power to the people
Now what you know about a cold winter in the middle of Chicago
Sitting 20 inches of precipitation on the pavement
I've been waiting for the warm weather
This sweater's getting heavy on me
Getting sweaty while I'm getting ever-ready
Like a wrestler, mentally in shape
I train about 5 times a day for like 9 hours straight
Tied tight around on my waist,
run a mile under 3
It's a breeze, I can do it all angles, 90 degrees
Gotta keep the knees up,
young buck never ease up
Kids take a seat, it's time to meet teach
Mike rock Economs
while I be on physics
JP engineers
Chuck instructs English
We up in this
Don't think for one minute I'll play dumb, you dunce
You come sit front and center
Pay attention to the lessons of professors
Speaking to our generation: now or never
Chip 216
It only take about an hour for a young G to get ready
How long it's gonna take you lightweights to get heavy?
A lot of niggas got rock, but my rock's steady
couple misfits with some 'fetti
Ride 'round LA blowing them trees
I need a soccer mom like that MILF off Weeds who sell weed
no need to wire that
'Scalade, Benz, Lex, whatever I decide to
Chuck don't fuck with foreign cars, but I do!
Louis covers up the eyes with your
Piru
And shut these corny-rapping niggas once I eye you
I had them Grandmama's with React Juice
The black-on-black Force Ones with the black swoosh
Triple fat Goose
Without scuffing my Timberland or Nike
Team Wolverine, U of M Huraches
They call me Jimmy King of the concrete
And I'm Jimmy Dean: high top beef
