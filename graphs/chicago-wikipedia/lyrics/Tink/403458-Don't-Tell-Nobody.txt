Baby, don't tell nobody
Yeah, I know what you're saying is the truth
Baby, don't tell nobody
Don't front me off in front of company
You know we could work that out
Maybe we should work that
Maybe we should work that out
You know we could work that
Baby, don't tell nobody
Don't front me off in front of company
I just text yo phone like 30 sometimes in a row
You ain't gotta lie 'cause it's going on 5
And if you ain't in my bed then you laying with a ho
So fuck that love shit
I don't feel none of that
Like I'm numb to the pain, said I'm done with the game, but I'm still here running back
'Cause I already know your lingo
You talk to these hoes like you're single
You know you really love pulling fast ones
Cheat, come home and act dumb
Pussy nigga, pussy nigga, listen nigga
I see shit even when you ain't in sight
I just hold it in like it's picture time
I've been holding back for a long while
Just hoping soon it'll turn around but
How can I word this?
You ain't been perfect
t
Tell me you working late
Your phone losing service
And now I'm here thinking like "This nigga tweakin"
You sorry, pathetic and far from authentic
You liar, you fronter, you just like these other, niggas
As much as I hate you, I still wanna date you
You better just hope I don't
Tell nobody
Yeah, I know what you're saying is the truth
Baby, don't tell nobody
Don't front me off in front of company
You know we could work that out
Maybe we should work that
Maybe we should work that out
You know we could work that
Baby, don't tell nobody
Don't front me off in front of company
Sick of this keep it on the DL shit
You say you with the bros when you out with a bitch
You say you at the crib when you leaving her place
I pull up to ya crib and you lie to my face
He like "Baby, you my all and all
I was in the bathroom when I missed ya call"
Nah, you was in the backseat sweating like an athlete
Doing everything that you said you wouldn't
But I ain't gon' trip on a weak ass nigga
I'ma just find me a nigga much bigger
I'ma just do the same shit that you do when I'm not up in the room
Yeah, baby, let's think
I'ma text Bryan, Facetime Ryan
Call up Keenan, tell 'em I need him
Niggas ain't loyal, and I knew from the jump
When you showed me the ropes that I wouldn't never have trust for you
You creepin, I'm leavin, you call me, I pick up, I hang up
You text me, "Let's link up"
Then I just say fuck it, then we end up fucking
Then it all repeats in the next 2 weeks
I'll be back on the same "I'm done" shit
If they only knew that I'd rather be loose
Man I'm tempted but I ain't gon'
You know we could work that out
Maybe we should work that
Maybe we should work that out
You know we could work that
Baby, don't tell nobody
Don't front me off in front of company
When I'm right there, the night gets better
You must admit we're one together
'Cause you don't talk that shit when I give you gas money
5 star chick, baby, when yo ass hungry
Good weed, good dick
Girl, you get it all from me
Plenty secrets of you and your world
Even me and you and your girls
I would never tell nobody
Yeah, I know what you're saying is the truth
Baby, don't tell nobody
Don't front me off in front of company
You know we could work that out
Maybe we should work that
Maybe we should work that out
You know we could work that
Baby, don't tell nobody
Don't front me off in front of company
