Would you do the same for me (x2)
I see I need someone crazy for my love
For my love (x2)
I need someone that’ll meet me there if I jump
If I jump (x2)
Would you dive to the bottom of the ocean, the ocean for me
If the cops came running and I had no time
(It all depends on you)
Will you be a fool for your lady
I just want somebody thats crazy for my love
Cause whether I’m down or whether I’m up
Going through things, you know it can get tough
Can I count on you, can I count on you
And if I pull the trigger will you bust back
You ain’t gotta ask, you know I’m gonna blast
Can I count on you, Can I count on you
The Devil’s in for me
Would you do the same for me (
Cause baby, you gotta be ready
Living this lifestyle
I say baby, you gotta protect me
Ooh cause it gets so wild
On my side will you ride
Ride, whether I’m wrong or I’m right yeah
Would you dive to the bottom of the ocean, the ocean for me
If the cops came running and I had no time
(It all depends on you)
Will you be a fool for your lady
I just want somebody thats crazy for my love
Cause whether I’m down or whether I’m up
Going through things, you know it can get tough
Can I count on you, can I count on you
And if I pull the trigger will you bust back
You ain’t gotta act, you know I’m gonna blast
Can I count on you, Can I count on you
Devil’s in for me
