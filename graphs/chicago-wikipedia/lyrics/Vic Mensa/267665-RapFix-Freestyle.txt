The first one was a fluke, anyone can get beginner's luck
Rookie think he too hot cause he drop bars about some Harry Potter books
And said some stuff about a semi truck
In them same cannabis print boxers, boy that shit HUF
Yeah, I heard of Vic, he sound like so and so and such and such
He ain't original, he ain't digital, he ain't the INNANET
Them Odd Future kids been had made that shit up
We ain't Savemoney, we si -- aight, aight enough
Multiply my numericals uncomparable
My tarots straight even in the slumps
They trying to beat me to the jump
Be like I'm skydiving without a parachute
You might drop first, but I'mma hit harder than ten of you
Eight out of nine of my dimes got smoker tendencies
I'm betting 35 like I'm from Oklahoma,
Tennessee
Tentative court date pending, they trying to sentence me
Send 'em and in-voice, out of state, lawyer handle my plea
You petty boys, don't address me or catch a Gettysburg
Blood on the leaves, bodies fall like autumn
All my fits off-season like Halloween and February
Word on the land is that I'm getting air play everywhere
I hit the ground running in '93, I should probably die when I'm 27
Heath Ledger lines to keep the work on the plane Like I'm staff
Plus I be flying free
Fresh outta jail, fire up the tree, in my bond receipt
Shout-out to the port huron police, keep my piss clean
Smoke strong like creatine,
cranapple juice to clear the trace
Clear papers when I'm writing, I be seeing green
Cut my negatives like a filmmaker switch screen, split screen
I Refrain from the shit they repeat
Ducking detectives trying to make the quota
See that 44 clap like the nolia in the streets
Niggas chances be slim gotta stay a soldier
Boy, it's been one hell of year, ain't it?
I left the band, became a man,
my brother Purp just had a daughter
Some of my other fam damn near famous
I'm still in the hood, same whip, same crib
Same homies where I used to serve OZs through the fence
Mask and a blade, you better hope d'Artagnan come to your defense
Fence in the field, I'mma hop it
Cops come I'm hurling the sack and changing the topic
Talk that mess, make me mop it
Buckshot, lunar eclipse split the black moon
I'm in--
Kufies ain't goofies
gave 'em rufies
And then you know they gave me some loose-leaf, paper
I said I'd do your favors to you later
I don't give a fuck about clans or the Raiders
Niggas know me and I came with the braids up
I don't give a ---
Is that a curse, I can curse?
(No, no, what's wrong with that? Keep going)
Because I freestyle in person
I gave you penis, I mean phoenix
You already know my shit the meanest
You could say penis on TV because it ain't a curse
It's worse, leave them in a hearse
Niggas wearing skirts
talking about us do dirt
You don't want Nerf
They don't want it because they shooting but they bullets made of Nerf
Let me hear something, Bun, what you gotta say?
It's all good, I'm representing UGK
We them dudes that mama told you about
I'm like Red from Five Heartbeats, open the window and hold you out
And this is freestyle, it didn't come written
So it's all good, we real emcees that's spittin'
On the turntables we got DJ Red Alert
He keep it mixing, I spit the the rhymes that make your head hurt
I make the world shake, I make the ground quake
Everything I do is groundbreaking, it's ground break
boys already know
Bun B repping UGK for life out the do'
This is PAT freestyle spittin'
Already said spittin' and written, no bullshitting, I'm here
And I'm killing it, keeping it trill
Boys already know they'll never touch me for real
So do your thing, but don't try to do me
That's it, just don't do me
Trying to be infamous, while you rappers is jicama
Many come try and get them some synonyms, what I'm spitting
The open casket if you asking, I dided them
So everybody crowd around, everybody be the shit but homie I'm the foulest bowel
See my vowels be pure like Al B. Sure's brows mane
Just trying to get a couple O's in the account mane
For now I count change
I'm flyer than a pilot
Never sex it up and dumb it down
Insane flow, I'm Usain Bolt I run this now what?
What time is it? What time clock looking like?
Rappers smoke crack, they need to go and cook a pipe
First the Fat Boys break up then Sway cut his dreads off
Then Vic Mensa came and cut they heads off
You hard, but your bread soft
Your legs off, chop them like a Mexican
The cartel come through every time that I'm flexing it
You know they disrespecting him
When I'm riding through and the glass is reflecting them
I see them phony, they trying to play me like we homies
They wrap me up that's why I come back around with the homies
And stomp them out
Come back home when I used to go from rags to rag and bone
Me and Rocky in this bitch killing
Still trilling
And I'm trilling with the nigga Bun
We can't curse? (Do what you gotta do, man)
And I'm with my homie Bun
Top gun, you know we number one
But hold up, let me get to the flashin' fashion
I got the new Dior's
And I don't give a fuck, got three floors
And like three broads and like three cars
And they all hoopties
And she got fake bags and they all Gucci's
And I like the strip clubs cause they all hoochies
You know I give them dollars
they love loosies
Everybody know the Prada, Prada
And you know hot Tamale's
You see me in the allies fucking popping Molly's
I ain't 'bout it though
I come around like where's Waldo?
And my breath stank, I need a Alto
