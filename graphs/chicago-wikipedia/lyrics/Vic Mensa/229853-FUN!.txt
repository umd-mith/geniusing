Hold my phone. And I was just like, and I was just lookin' in the sun and I was just like, man, this shit is about havin' fuckin' fun. This shit is all about fun. All of this music shit to me, I do this shit for fun, man. Like, it's a real ass hustle, right now, it's 100% real, you know. We trynna turn it into a business, but it's about fun though. Music, man. Music is about fun, music is fun to me. I love it. More than fun, it's about love. I need to just not forget that
