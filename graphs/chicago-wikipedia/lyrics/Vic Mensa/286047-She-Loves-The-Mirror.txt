There's not much I can do for you, it's just too late, too late
You stand inside this hole wholeheartedly, you dig your grave
I've been here long enough to see you lie your way up top
But do you think you'll stand there where you are when everyone else drops?
They're gonna walk away
I would be with you if not for the fact you don't
Know your right from wrong, these glares, only yourself who you behold
I've been too low, trying to hold my hand to be the one you trust
She doesn't care
She loves the mirror
She doesn't care
She loves the mirror
She doesn't care
She loves the mirror
She doesn't care
