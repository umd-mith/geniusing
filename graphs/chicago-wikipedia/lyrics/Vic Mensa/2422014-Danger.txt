Free man shit
We don't need no cops 'round here
I got my dick in hand
Cause I know a lot of y'all niggas running scared
I got God on my side and I know the devil
Trying to take a nigga under, really makes me wonder
And I'm feeling like the 2nd coming
As I fucked the world for the first time and she love it
I think this life is the only one for me
I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless
She was 5'7", pretty waist
Coke bottle, basket case
You know me, I like the danger
You know me, I like the danger
I'm on I-95
Double fist tequila while I drink and drive, yeah
2016 I gotta get it now
Pray to God I'm still alive
put your lighters up
Let me take you where I was
Southside ain't safe outside
Seen a nigga standing on 47th street
With a black Glock nine in the sky, put your bangers up
Yeah, twist your fingers up, fingers up
Niggas yelling "Gang!" but niggas ain't tailored up
Nah, inked up, I'm tatted up
I let all my niggas talk for they self
They like to jugg, man they like easy money
They like making that shit hard for they self
I just realized I don't fuck with y'all
I just gotta stack my money tall
You know that feeling when you at the bank
Tryna quit cigarettes going through withdrawals
Lying through they teeth niggas too fake
That's the reason really, really why I hate you all
That's how I feel out here, shit is real out here
Young niggas really out here in the field out here, yeah
What's the deal out here?
And it's still our year
Niggas say they catching up they still not here
I'm looking around like, "Where the fuck y'all at?"
If you scared better keep your punk ass in the back
I think this life is the only one for me
I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless
She was 5'7", pretty waist
Coke bottle, basket case
You know me, I like the danger
You know me, I like the danger
I don't like the way that niggas talking like they bulletproof
Until they gotta find out what a bullet do
Catch two in your Canada Goose
It'll turn a nigga into Proof, ooh
Shout out to my niggas on 8 Mile
Shout out my niggas on Flatbush
Man shout out to my niggas up in K-Town
Gangbanging, rolling up the ops in the Backwoods
Yeah, don't get turned into a pack kid
You know how to act kid, you know where we at yeah
You know what The Blueprint is
Ain't really shit for me and Jay to lay a nigga flat yeah
And we build it from the ground man
I made the foundation like bitches with make-up
You're flexing your Jacob
get cut like a shape up
The city so hot it might dry the whole lake up
I need a bitch that's A1 like the steak sauce
Pussy so good I might save like my pesos
Bitch and my gang, I'm the chief like a Halo
I go hard in the paint like a DayGlo
I tell Steve Aoki he look like Towkio
I'm on my new Hov and Nas it's a takeover
Young boy but I'm an OG like I'm Maco
I think this life is the only one for me
I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless
She was 5'7", pretty waist
Coke bottle, basket case
You know me, I like the danger
You know me, I like the danger
