She told me everything don't always work the way you want it
I said I'm only trying to get as close as I can get
I left her laying by her lonesome early in the morning
Didn't even tell her nothing, I just said I had to dip
I'm speeding down the highway now, my top down
Breeze in my head will keep me cool cuz I'm hot now
Heated, miss me with love I don't need it
I was born to be a legend, it was written... nigga read it
This is life music, that having problems with your wife music
Neck to the edge of the knife music
Please, a few pills past the recommended dose
Swear another Advil could probably turn me to a ghost
I'm off one, listening to
Lauryn Hill "Lost Ones"
At 40,000 feet everything looks awesome
Even the coupes turn to itty-bitty dots
You can't even see the niggas you could only see the blocks
Like...
When you're all alone
Champagne drinkin', sittin' there waitin', what're you thinkin'?
No, don't be scared now
I know you want me
So send me that...
Send me that body (x3)
Send me that...
Send me that body (x3)
(talking: Yeah, take a picture, a naked picture)
I know you want me
I told her everything don't always work the way you want it
But if you try then you could find that you get what you need
We kept a lot of shit between us, never got confronted
She ain't really speaking, me - I wear my problems on my sleeve
It was before I learned to hide what I was feeling
Cuz to let somebody see you when you low is to concede a loss
We worried women skip church keep sinnin'
Shit cuz bitch I paid the cost to be the boss
I'm back-back ballin' on em, a couple racks, take a cab home
Flippin' 5 chicks for every bitch a nigga jagged on
A lot of nice drink til one of us is gettin' dragged home
Life is playing playground tackle with no pads on
You take hits, take chances and take trips
We break records like old people break hips
At times I wonder if I lost it
My mind floats to you everytime I get exhausted
I'm right there
Sittin here on the phone
Yes I've been drinkin', enough about me, girl guess what I'm thinkin'
No I'm not there now
But I know you want me
So send me that, right now
Baby tonight now
No need to fight now
Want you to send me that, right now
Baby tonight now
You in your night gown
Want you to send me that...
Send me that body (x3)
I know you want me
