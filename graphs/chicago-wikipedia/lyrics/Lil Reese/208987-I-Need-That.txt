I heard he holdin', on the low.. I need that
He say he
out here in the field
then show me that
Man these niggas not forreal man, I'm knowin' that
And watch my set I'm from the Lam go nuts, and watch they fall back
Niggas ain't never did shit for me, looked out or none of that
Now how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back
Put 300 on my back, I'm a runningback
Now how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back
Doing me that's where it's at,
no sneak dissin' none of that
At the top that's where we at, yall beneath us that's where yall at
Old niggas talking bout them old racks but where they at?
And if he holding old racks we running in, now where they at?
Same hood same niggas, this where we at
Look out for my family man, fuck the rest
And if you with me then you with me man, fuck the rest
Head shots when we aiming man
a vest
I been gettin' money and niggas hatin, that shit don't make sence
I don't give a fuck about no diss
I'm ballin hard like K.D. fourth quarter I can't miss
They hatin' they sneak dissin', most do it over a bitch
And you better not give me one shot, I promise you I ain't gon' miss
ain't no new shit
We shootin' shit extended clip, take you to movist
And it's 300 fuck the opps
