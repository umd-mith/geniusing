Ain't no play
These fake ass niggas, O.V.A
Ain't no play
These snake ass niggas, O.V.A
Nigga ain't no play
These snitch ass niggas, O.V.A
Had to close up shop
Niggas hold all the rocks, done for the day
And I'm a hundred round drum
AK-47 right around that bay
Young nigga on the come up
I'm gonna try to fuck 100,000 hoes this summer
Fuck with me and I dumps nigga
Make a move and get moved on
Pushin' packs to my young niggas
Serving dope in your school zone
I need some zone in that backpack
The 38's and 9's, we got that
I'm gonna take my lil' niggas on field trips
We straight kill shit
Where them sacks at, bitch
Getting road head in a rover
Chevy thang' got a new motor
Fucking with the cane and the soda
Got that yola
Whole things, halfs, and the quarters
Real ass nigga I told ya
These fake ass niggas be all in your face
And I ain't gon' play
Keep that thing on my waist
So you know I'm gon' spray
30 in his face
Take his ass to the crib, make him find that safe
And I beat that case
Stay rolling up loud, to the face
My mouth duck taped
These snake ass niggas be talking to the jakes
And it's O.V.A
By all means I gotta get that cake
I don't fuck with the fake
And I party with the 8
Keep the squares out the shake
My block move yay
My name, ho wait
Louis V on my waist
Just to hold my waist
Just to hold my waist
