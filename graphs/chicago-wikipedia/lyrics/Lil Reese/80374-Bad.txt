Bitch I'm doing me, you should be yourself
I gotta get this money man, there's nothing else
Never switch up on your niggas
That's bad for your health
Never switch up on your niggas
That's bad for your health
I never switch up on my niggas, I don't do that there
Never bitch up on my niggas, I don't do that there
Catch me everywhere that money at and I bet I'm there
And bitch I'm doing me, I just be myself
We don't fuck with new niggas, so don't bring them here
Only the family where I'm at, and bitch that's O.T.F
And I blow loud for health
I can't help myself
I'm going in for the kill and I don't need no help
I love money, fuck a bitch I won't stress myself
And bitch I keep my mouth closed cause I could trust myself
I'm fucking other niggas wives
I'm going in for the kill
And I don't need no help
I gotta get this money, man there's nothing else
Gucci for my waist, that's a designer belt
And I've never been a pussy, we could take it there
My hood would never let me, we could take it there
And we keep them tools around so please don't get near
Ok, hold on I'm broke, I guess I'll take what's there
Ok they playing like they real, but they ain't really real
They talk about the streets but bitch I'm in the field
My youngest rob and kill, so tell me what's real
I don't fuck with fuck niggas cause they quick to tell
My youngest rob and kill, so tell me what's the deal
Ok my youngest rob and kill, so tell me what's the deal
