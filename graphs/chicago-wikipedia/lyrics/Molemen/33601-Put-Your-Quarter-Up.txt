"Trapped in a deadly video game..." [GZA] 7x
"...with just one man" [GZA]
Put your quarter up
I got first (Sluggo)
And I'm the type of customer that orders the works
Not the same as any
I run the game of plenty
I buy my nickels from a dime who goes by the name of Penny
The Last Starfighter
searching for the Starfucker
The drunk parallel parker
thank God for car bumpers
Another day, shot in the head and buried
While your wifey tries to convince me that she shouldn't have got married
From the Galaga bugs
amateur thugs
To the punk rock chicks that can't handle my hugs
I'll be standin upon the web, born out of a thought
Where the spider makes her bed out of the carcasses she caught
Aiyyo she's got that good head, me I got dandruff
She wears a smile, and me I wear handcuffs
Yo wait a minute savior, how about a little truth
You couldn't save yourself if you had a cape and a phonebooth
The roof is on fire, the floor is underwater
The fish ignored the bait and ate the bobber
And as God hovers up above the highway and the chopper
I'm down here writing songs for her daughter (Is that your quarter?)
"Trapped in a deadly video game..." [3x]
"...with just one man"
My underhanded summerjam escaped with a free game in my back pocket
budget that have me bummin cigarettes
I'll do the deed myself before the second leaping sheep
Even got counted
Jay Gatsby the great
bashing open the plastic backspins
Strapped with a plague and a cocktail napkin
Wrapped in oragami dragon fashion
Flashed in a effort to smash your pattern
Pen magnanimous
I'll skip town once these upright citizens sit down
Uh, yo I go next, put your quarter up
For bets, put your daughter up
MF is sorta corrupt
Still the one who used to take your high score down
With more rhymes than germs a spitball carry
Pitfall Harry
Shit y'all fairies take a loss like Slobodan
Robotron
Before the end, I save the world like
Defender
There's no time for curling up to hurl from a bender
Like back when your last five never went to weed
More likely on like twenty rounds of
Centipede
If it go fast or slow, no mattering
The flow down pat like the ole Acro pattern
Those need to learn the technique, take heed, note
Spy Hunter
when he *psst* to the speedboat
