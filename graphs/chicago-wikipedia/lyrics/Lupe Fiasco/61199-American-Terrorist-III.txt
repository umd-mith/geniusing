[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
Hello Gorgeous
This phone call's probably being recorded
Just know that I did it for the four of us
And those motherfuckers kept ignorin' us
After this I'm going underground
If they come asking give them the run-around
How does Costa Rica in the summer sound?
Couple days then we moving to another town
Just know that time'll never come between
Space either,
fake features
Things that we reject but connects all us believers
The insurrection's gone viral
They'll never stop it now,
I hope it all spirals
Outta control, like a dam with a hole
From here on out it's all about survival
The way we left things they probably think we rivals
But don't be naive, they hate you more than I do
Remember always speak in opposites
I hate you so much, it's such a compliment
I know that defies the common sense
But we ain't never been right:
honestness
We never fit in school, and never did rules
But who'd a thought we'd turn out bombing shit
I'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear
[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
He said he was just so tired
Of them fighting our water with fire
He said that we need something drier
To really impress the empire
Funny cause he really hated war
But why we went to war is what he really hated more
Said it's silly how that our schools make us stupid and our jobs make us poor
When he came back from the Corps
Is when he really got serious
Read a lot of books, started acting all mysterious
The VA is what really made him furious
Told him his condition didn't exist, period
That's why he started that petition
Went all the way to Washington, said they didn't listen
To a white male Christian
He just laughed when they took our father's pension
He said that you gotta act in opposites
Helps you hide your tracks when you stand up to the dominant
But I knew he felt bad
Told me later was the saddest day he ever had
To see our dad so hopeless
That was the turning point that's what really gave him focus
I didn't agree with everything, some of it made sense
But never thought that he would do something like this
[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
I know you don't watch but your brother was on TV
Couple guys in black suits came around to see me
They went through all your books and took all of your CDs
My granny said you'd be all right, she saw it in the tea leaves
All the operations going well, had a lotta contact from all the other cells
Everybody, everywhere is calling you a hero
They going through the rubble, but the body count is zero
It's all violent and bloodless
I know the government really loves this
This account is hacked, you know how to keep in touch
I'll never see you again, I hate you so much
There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
