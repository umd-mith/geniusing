Chilli sauce on the Panda
Chow mein be redder than Santa
Ferrari got spots in Santana
Driver like Juelz Santana
Teriyaki, Panda, bigger plate, Panda
Wait in the line I got manners
I work with them chop sticks like Daniel
Teriyaki, Panda, orange chicken, Panda
Honey walnut Panda, express myself, Panda
I know it I don't need no samples
I'm a professional don't need examples (no)
That sweet fire chicken bananas
Might have me dancing like Hammer
Chilli sauce on the Panda
Chow mein be redder than Santa

I don't be messing with the fizzies though, I might get me a Aquafina or maybe like the Oceanspray
Drogas, Drogas, Drogas, Drogas
I used to drop bands at Philippe's
I let you see the receipts
They even gave me a jacket
But I take it back to the streets
A tray cause I'm takin' a seat
Or I might take it straight to the Jeep
You flex if your Ex got a drive thru
Niggas don't hate when you eat
Fortune cookie told me my future
Said that I'm gonna be super
It said that I'm gonna be super
As long as I don't do nothin' stupid
Old shit is classic, it's cougar
Black Panther anthem, that cool look
Truly I'm Huey, no Aaron McGruder put air in your SCUBA
Might take you down to crustaceans
Might take you down to the depths
Or go to Dieppe
Ever rode through Paris on the chair of a scooter?
Feelin' myself I'm the master
I'mma get money like pastors
I wanna live in a castle
Where me and my panda gon' rastle
Dread so I look like a rasta
Ferrari pull up to your Vauxhall
Mate, my enemy Holden
I was in China rockin' mastermind designer ate the food but this what I told 'em
I mean it's aight
But we got, we got some shit back at the crib
That's the shit
You know what I'm sayin' niggas tryna flex

Gunshots I make with my mouth (raaah)
Dumb shit, don't say with my mouth (no)
Know that I fuck with the South (yeah)
Back there they treat me like Michael
Rappers they treat me like Daigo
Press really think that I'm psycho
Genius should just be my bible
Gotta annotate for these dumb niggas (watch out, watch out)
I'm just foolin', boy, I'm just havin' fun with ya
Tetsuo was genius smart but when that Drogas drop on your computers
Fuck Genius boy, you gon' need a genius bar, god damn
I mean for like 14, like 11 dollars you can really, you can eat good
Chilli sauce on the Panda
