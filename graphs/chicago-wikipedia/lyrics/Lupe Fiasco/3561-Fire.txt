I was about as uncool as a niece's mother's biggest brother
But now it's all butter
Now I'm bout as uncool as some cover to a pool from a puddle
Like a monsoon but subtler
Slowly pull up my pants
A sagger to a flooder
Now you need a submarine
the way I'm cuffin' my jeans
Like I'm arrestin' my dress code
The dress clothes and the dress toes
So let's roll
Ghetto Lambda Lambda's how I address those
Niggas might peep and think geek
But you need that when you knee-deep goin' on waist-high
Get up to your neck just like a great tie
I finally got the Windsor
Like on my eighth try
Your shirt's still soakin' wet
Your slacks ain't dry
And I have yet to even fall from the sky
I'm hotter than red with a head full of lye
Better run and get Spike, tell him I'm on fire
Hell, I don't wanna see you like a male stripper
Wish you well like a wishin' well wisher wish itself
It fell at first so now I sail with you
If it happen to sink
I pitch in with pails
And pitchers, bucket, and cup it back to the river
Then cover the leak
with Garbage Pail Kid stickers
Now your flow look like my bedroom door when I was four
No rockin that boat, or you be swimmin', fo sho
Oh, I stay ship-shape all aboard
That's just how I roll
When I try and keep the run afloat
Hating's a disease
And it's deadly if you catch it
Crabs in the bucket
Always tryna pull me backwards
Position rarely change so they don't really matter
If not the same then similar like Asher and Mathers
Bully or I bogard
Bodacious so I'm Humphrey
I used to rubber band but now I got a bungee
If you let me expand
That refers to the money
Gucci's all good
Chanel is all chummy
And that ain't even for me
My honey and my mommy
I'd rather be bummy, nappy on top
Cipriani in my tummy
The fade is for the fans
Not even for my fans
It's more for like the brand
The sign language lady who be translatin' my jams
You really like the beats or you barely understand
Why I throw my set up wherever I am
Man, it's cause I love my town
My mind was a sponge, but now it's Sham-Wow
I never throw in the towel so just wipe me down
But don't you get too close
They might have to put you out
