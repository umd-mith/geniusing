Waddup Pharrell?
Uh! Its the Revenge Of The Nerd
Got a way with words like I got away with murder
Like I caught the state star witness tryin' to purge us
Sent the purse to the judge and bribed off the jurors
West Side yes I roll here like a curler
And I hold hair like a hurler,

The money of the merger of the worlds of the worker and the surfer
Return to my girl, UH Lunch, dinner, desert/dessert her
Like a armed forces server that served in Desert Storm
That couldn't perform any further,
A breath of fresh air like Certs
Slightly off my walls made of Serta
Hero to the star crossed lovers in search of…
Yea, and thats what a verse does
I represent the First droppin' the vert reverse cuz...
