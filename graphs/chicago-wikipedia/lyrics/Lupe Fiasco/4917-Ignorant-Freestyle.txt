And since I'm presently on the incline
I feel inclined to invite y'all
In the mind I'm feelin' real spiffy
Signed sealed illest label deal in the city
Check me and my fifty dollar fifty-nine fifty
Buyin' diamonds is just no longer in me
So no more chains flooded watches on the right hand
I work like a Mexican spend like a White man
That's right man
I could Bentley afford
Instead I copped a couple skateboards
And some sneakers
My kick game is crazy
Don't get gassed up on what you pomp-pomps think
Cause the heart still dark as Mont Blanc ink
But the real OG'S told me fall on back
You got a Secret Service now you call on that
If that ain't real, man, I fall on tacks
And hold the Westside down like it's a coast
Bishop G, they told me I should come down cousin
But I flatly refuse
I ain't dumb down nothin'
Like BOW
Lovin' the Chi right now
Comm Sense the priest
Bump Jay the chief
Kanye the champ
Twista man the beast
Crucial still the king
Kato, rest in peace
I'm Lupe the Jedi
Jay don't mind me I'm just blowin' my zone up
Doin' it bout as fly as a maggot grown up
And still got a life that's backing the poems up
Just give me a foldin' chair I ain't after the
Throne but
Got a broken lamp flow that nobody ain't touch
Just sayin if FnF ain't up
Friend naw
This ain't a pen, this a paint brush
And I intend to rearrange how they paint us
