You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
With a platinum plaque
It's like Robbin, George, and Jack
The mind fears what the blinds hide
But I'm here on the blind side
Hanging up till the line dies
Then off the hook for the crimes tried
Get awful looks from tribe
Tribe unlawful jux when you climb skies
That's Robin Hood, arrows of the rich'll steal
In Hollywood and featherweight
I step by step, let it escalate
Till you get it, will tell you if I hit it
We can make pie if we don't fidget
Xzibit, Pimp My Ride exquisite
We G's coach us back if we die in business
My Lord is my chemist
My sword is from Khemet
Egyptian fonts and ankhs
Scottish writes with Montblancs let us stomp
I walk as my father walk, master builder is what I thought
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
Where the golden means, so the overseer gets overseen
And the over here's are the older things
Can see the bell but don't know the rings
The rings are not sounds, but circles
Wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel
Till it's all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And it's dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
The applause and patience of the laws in nature
Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
