[Hook]
You would never know if you could ever be
If you never try
you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy
or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't feared it
so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions
civil war got avoided
Little black sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Qu'ran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where Fox News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela Peace Prize
[Hook]
You would never know if you could ever be
If you never try
you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy
or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
Uh, and it ain't no projects
Keepin' it real is not an understood concept
Yea, complexion's not a contest
Cause racism has no context
Hip-hop ain't got a section called conscious
Everybody rappin' like crack never happened
Crips never occurred nor bloods to attack them
Matter of fact no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was a cool group of black men
That inspired the five white guys called the Jacksons
Eminem fitted in but then again
He inspired a black rapper tryin' to mimic him
And that's what really rose up out of Michigan
The "sounding white" rapper by the name of 50 Cent
[Hook]
You would never know if you could ever be
If you never try
you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy
or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why can't it be
Now we can do nothing bout the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman queen and every man a king and
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes till its all black everything
[Hook]
You would never know if you could ever be
If you never try
you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy
or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
