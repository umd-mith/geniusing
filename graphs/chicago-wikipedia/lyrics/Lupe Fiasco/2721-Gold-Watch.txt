(Oh, give the drummer some, yeah, yeah
Oh, give the drummer some, yeah, yeah
Oh, give the drummer some, yeah, yeah
Oh, give the drummer some, yeah, yeah)
Let's peruse the essentials of Cool
A brief study on the things so instrumental to Lu
That make me feel flyer than lobbies of Ws
A disclaimer, just a rhymer, no credentials from a school
In my Fall of Rome jeans, my Head Porter wallet
My Neighborhood shirt and my Eddie Chen CLOT
Shit might not go to college but my street smart polished
Like the black fingernails of that punk rock logic
Do the knowledge: man, you can't be punk from projects
Firm disbeliever in your punch clock promise
Was trading off my comics, I was taking them to school
One of Jay-Z boys, now I'm skating in your pool
Not to be rude, I'm just hating on your rules
Like a young 50,
I'm on my world tour
Good morning, Singapore, I'm bringing the sun with me
From the Robert Taylor homes
to Africa's slum cities
I am American mentally with Japanese tendencies
Parisian sensibility, so stay out the vicinity of
Yeah, yeah, them niggas over there, it's just
Yeah, yeah, now look at what I wear
Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my fancy broad and she foreign
So it's no words and it's no slang
And I'm no trick and I'm no lame
It's just so slick that she's so game, and it's
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, and it's
[Verse 2]
I like Diptyque candles
and Maharishi sandals
and
Dita sunglasses,
Purple Murder Service samples
I like False T-shirts
Dover Street is off the handle
Such a good designer, Junya Watanabe, god damn you
Yohji Yamamoto
and a Max Roach solo
I like Montblanc pens and Moleskine paper
Monocle magazine
Futura
Nosferatus
and HTM trainers
I love Street Fighter 2, I just really hate Zangief
Only Ken and Ryu, I find it hard to beat Blanka
Keep a Wee Ninja hanging
and an UNKLE album banging
If you negative in energy, then stay out the vicinity
Got my gold watch
and my gold chain
With my fancy car
and my diamond ring
With my ghetto broad and she's so plain
Got a couple scars and one of those long names
She-a fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
And her ex-man had her baggin' up cocaine, but she
But my most coveted thing is a high self-esteem
And a low tolerance for them telling me how to lean
See, the most important parts are the ones that are unseen
The wings don't make you fly and the crown don't make you king
Now, God don't like ugly, ain't too happy 'bout pretty
I am ignorance's enemy so stay out the vicinity of
Yeah, yeah, them niggas over there, it's just
Yeah, yeah, now look at what I wear
