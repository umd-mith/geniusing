[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above
Velvet hands in the upper glove, touch
Like bad double dutch
And two Amsterdam's ain't enough, D.R.U.G.S
"Don't ruin us, God said", hashtag drogas
Too much pride we electric slide, we should be closer
Like soca, not a chain but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures
Pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
High as the angel on the Dikembe's shoulder
Eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades
Bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak
Park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening
Or two feet on a Riesling, slow wind
Meditate until there's no mind
Decorate me with shine till I go blind
BDSM dominated it with no bind
Safe word is don't stop, both or don't go no times
Proceed to the next level
(Tron)
Proceed to the next level
(Tron)
Coolest, tulips, flowers, fall from the towers
Like balls from Galileo to lay low
Ignorance is that the world isn't ours, the gall
Give them all showers
Tony found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of powder
To only find truth in the fountain, drowning in power
Surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder
Cut, that's a mis-direct to stir the soul with dis-effect
Names don't last like Mr. X
Unless you Galilee, dropping bowling balls on the discotheque
With a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
Dance, it's a new year
Every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal
Yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy
Tsunami you up off your surfboard
Midas turn Medusas into gold
'Fore Versace turned words into turquoise
Medusa turned coke into stone
With a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said
Proceed to the next level
[Bridge: Troi Irons]
Come so far, seen so much (Tron)
I cannot settle for good enough
So I'll sweat and I'll climb until I reach my prime
(Proceed to the next level)
The forces rise and fall again
Through it all, I'll reach the end
In my eyes, there's a fire and it takes me high
[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Uh, Yeah, Soulo!
Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll be among the stars (space)
Backstroke in my pool of thought but don't mind the sharks (wavy)
Ab-solar system intergalactic soldier
Lupe say I'ma stoner, I say that I'm much bolder
Trapped in a game where the trap is the game
Scope this horror, Aquariuses make it rain here
No love for your honor, only God can judge us
If you're Islamic, Allah, I've had it up to my collar
With these niggas castin' stones like this Mancala
Proceed to the next level, dig that with a platinum shovel
Black magic, matter of fact, if matter is fact
A matter factory is in the making perhaps
Uh, erase your database
We race against time, no time to set a date
Tetsuo & Youth induced
Too cool for school, unloose the noose and
[Outro: Troi Irons]
We're going up, we're going up
Next level, next floor
I'm ready for it
I've been waiting all my life
Tron, Tron
We're going up, we're going up
Next level, next floor
