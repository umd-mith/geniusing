[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
This one goes out to the baby girls
In a rush growing up in this crazy world
Yeah your brother on the road and he never home
I know you feeling kinda sad now that daddy gone
You can't let it get you down, gotta carry on
We only lose things because it make us strong
You always had my love, and now you got a song
From the biggest biggest fan that you've ever known
I know you won't be little girls, not for very long
And you ain't gotta have a man if you don't ever want
Cause I'm gonna make sure you got two of everything
That you ever want, every tone, like your very own
Not to make you hard to respect
Just really really really really hard to impress
It's a whole wide world for you to go and get your hands on
Until then, just come and get your dance on now
I see you coming up
I'm a give you the low-down, down, down
You ain’t never gotta worry about nothing
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round
Uh, this for everybody feeling good
You know who you are, or you misunderstood
Never had money, or you living good
If you from the burbs, if you in the hood
Recognize where we come from
In my day, mane, I did a little somethin' some
They like "how come you don't rap that?"
Cause that's a back track and I ain't tryna back that
I'm only moving forward, homie, that's that
Direction, a lot of shawties lack that
I'm just tryna' give it to 'em like sat nav
That's cool as long as they don't trap crack
Graduate from school, and still let his pants sag
Never catch a case, know how to let his cash stack
Welcome to the map, go anywhere you tap now
I see you coming up (uh)
I'm a give you the low-down, down, down (alright, alright, alright)
You ain’t never gotta worry about nothing
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round
When the floor falls out
I'mma be there to carry you
And if you want that star
I'll go get it out the sky for you
If you cry, shed a tear
I'mma dry your eyes
Just to let you know it'll be alright
Maybe baby, on the way, and you feel so alone
Know that in this world you're never really on your own
God got a number get him on the phone
He'll never put you places where you don't belong
Put you through the pain, to put you on the throne
And I know that from the bottom of my
corazon
And if they looking at you sideways
You just wave right back, tell 'em hi hater
Mad you ain't hanging with 'em in the driveway
Nah we gon' keep it moving to the highway
Strong is puttin' on, the weak is all over like Friday, chilling
Shout out to King David for bringing in Philly
And all my pretty independent women in the building, let's go!
