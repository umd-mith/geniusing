I'm already knowing ya'll cowards at heart
And I'm prone to school niggas like Howard and Clark
Any youngin' get it crunk is surrounded by chalk
Niggas is street...where the kid is highway
And I'm known to sling bricks like Craig in Friday
Steam clips and hold submachines sideways
It's not a game ack
I even aim my stray shots with stones the size of raindrops
200 all in the same watch
And you don't want to owe me money like Kain pops
24/7, I'm always here like the theme from Bay Watch
With 'Caine, rock, and Trainspot
They all cooking the same, hooking your brain
Like Sugar Shane, I'll leave you shook and ashamed
It's essential, smell me?
Run this wisdom 'cross your nose
I'm a hustler
I ran them chickens 'cross the road
It's not a joke. I made chickens cross the road
Lay the mack down, run this pimpin' 'cross your hoes
Pick the mack up, you sponging stitching up your hoes
Flip your Lac truck
You're running tripping over your clothes
I'ma seize ya, I'll make you a believer
You the type to get charged like Visas
Get in the bing and sing like divas
Buck shots leave your face looking like receivers
Stay on my op,
stay on the block, and stay on the top
Like freezers
I'm over the wall
Running from blood hounds and retrievers
I don't like you and I don't fuck with him either, so give me three meters
I bang nigga
