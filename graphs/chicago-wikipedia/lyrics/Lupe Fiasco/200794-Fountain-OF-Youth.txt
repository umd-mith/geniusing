That puts me in a stupor
Kinda like saying I wanna see the young you in the future
Scratch that, to deepen the absurdity
Certainly to remain young in the face of getting old requires plastic surgery
And I've never been 1 to fake it and give you young shit from an old ass nigga with a facelift
I still hip so if it ain't break, don't replace it
These the complexes of a complex nigga in the face of criticism so basic
When your basics are the basic mathematics of spaceships
And if I do dumb it down for dumb niggas or younger crowds...to pay rent
An old man with younger styles on some Jay shit
My old fans run around and trash my latest efforts at making records as watered down so go old
But forgetters that Food & Liquor didn't go Gold
I mean G is G
I don't do this shit for free, always for some freedom
But niggas got lawyer fees in that Windy City where rapping is a breeze
A Twis-ta nig-ga you-so...cra-zy
Would I do when they want that young Lu?
"Nigga tell em time machine or Fuck-You, Pay-Me
