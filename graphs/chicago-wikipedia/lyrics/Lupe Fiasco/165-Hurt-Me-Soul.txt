This one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To everybody out there…
Ya digggggg
Now I ain't trying to be the greatest
I used to hate hip-hop, yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word "bitch", cursing - I wouldn't say it
Me and dog couldn't relate, till a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort of liked
Yeah, further ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's "It Was Written"
Intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot,
tap the world and listen,
it drop
[Hook]
My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
this nonsense built me
They bomb my village,
they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me
my master beats me
And it hurts me soul
[Verse 2]
I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking "Golly, God, guard me from the ungodly"
But by my 30th watching of "Streets is Watching"
I was back to giving props again and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as an untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to
Seem wrong, but these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into
And thought what constitutes a prostitute
is the pursuit of profit
Then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things
With the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said, "Don't knock it, mind your business
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimping got it"
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired
they cross on fire
We all got suspended,
I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign,
I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers,
poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me
Turn off my TV cause it hurts me soul
[Verse 3]
So through the Grim Reaper sickle sharpening
Macintosh marketing
Oil field augering
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation
Islamic martyrdom, precise
Yeah, laser guided targeting
Oil for food bartering,
terrorist organization harboring
Sand camouflage army men
CCF sponsoring,
world conquering,
telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering,
bulimic vomiting
Catholic priest fondling,
preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama in them
They breaking in my car again,
deforestation and overlogging
Hennessy and Hypnotiq swallowing,
hydroponic coughing and
All the world's ills, sitting on chrome 24-inch wheels,
They say I'm infected, this is why I inject it
I had it aborted,
we got deported
My laptop got spyware,
they say that I can't lie here
But I got no place to go
I can't stop eating,
My pastor touched me,
I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
