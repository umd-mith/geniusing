This world ends, this world ends
This world ends, this world ends
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now
She love her people so much
Came to my show just to throw her flag up and
Pray to God that I saw her
Wonder if she saw my scarf for Palestine all on it
Love the struggle,
Valentine all on it
Put my heart into it
Like Noah's Ark I'm too into it
Like justice I'm just too influenced not to do this to it
This one dedicated to the soldiers
Throw up peace signs in the face of bulldozers
Never bow down or wrap their body in explosives
As long as your alive, fight your whole lifetime
The Horn of Africa needs you
Calling out to all you friends of the people
Be the change that you wanna see
Tell em no change just ain't what it gonna be
Yeah, the people, united, will never be defeated
And on the People's Mic this forever be repeated
Whose streets, our streets, it'll never be deleted
No matter how many cops that you send to try and beat it
This is revolution in the making
A ragtag movement set to takeover the nation
Now isn't that fun
You just wanna make the world better, isn't that young
Well, blessings to the youth then
And don't stop, until they let the truth in
Once there, never let it leave
And protect it, they'll catch it and never set it free
And every set is free
Blood sweat and tears, no place I'd rather be
So, let's occupy Wall Street, all day, all week
So again, I fight evil
This what I gotta do to live my life peaceful
So be it, outspoken and low key it
My heart big, limousine no Fiat
And you can hear it loud every time God beat it
Love always shines every time I see it
Exactly what they hated is exactly what I needed
And exactly where I started is exactly where I leave it
Cause I ain't never ever ever change
I say that because I ain't never felt better mane
Beautiful LASERS as fans, do me a favor, this is how I repay ya
Friend of the peeps, free Chill, Esco at peace
Holla at me if you see me in the streets
A picture costs a dollar,
First and Fifteenth
