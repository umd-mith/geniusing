If we could break down those walls to set you free, we would
Cause we're out here, and we miss you
If we could build a ladder that tall to come up and see you, we would
Cause we're down here, and we miss you
If we could break down those walls to set you free, we would
Cause we're out here, and we miss you
If we could build a ladder that tall to come up and see you, we would
Cause we're down here, and we miss you
