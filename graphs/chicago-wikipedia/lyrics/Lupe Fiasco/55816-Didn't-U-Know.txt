Uh uh uh uh uh
Yeah
That’s what I’m talking about
Lemme clean my glasses
Lemme wipe off my sneakers
Lemme tilt my hat
You understand
Calm down shorty the alpha dude’s up
They don’t wanna touch ‘em they alpha dude touch
Just when they think they getting slick I lift
Switch my altitude up
Drop a little jewelry down
Pick my valuables up
They like the way I Converse
They alpha dude Chucks
But these tailors(Taylors) here are tailor-made for me
The Geminis the Pros and the Sh-Shayla Gs
A four-man squad that’ll play your league
Play you four on forty give you a hundred-point lead
Then we still pimp the game like it’s Hunter’s point, please
Homie (Homie)
Y-y-ya know me (ya know me)
You might see me down Stoney Island
Ridin’-
Madison-Travelin’
Michigan-Visitin’
Roosevelt-Rollin’
Home and Roamin’
Halstead-Walkin’
Jeffrey’s-Joggin’
Yes these problems
Didn’t you know? (echo)
I’m over ya heads like Excedrin
Keep pumping me like a veteran
I take state, raise stakes while joggin’
We take nationals no bargains
I’m barging through the door
I’m tired of knocking my knuckles are sore
hot like TNT
pop D and D not
Time to get my grown woman on like bees and the birds
Me and my squad like peas in a pod
FNF
I do it for the letters
I do it for the cheddar
I chat different listen
I put it all together
Wonder how I remain cool
When I’m pedaling the fire
When niggas got littler than a sweater in the dryer
Homie I was a pusher of medicines for hire
So I can walk through the cookers without sweating my attire
Get through the drought without sweating my supplier
Without giving out my connect to the buyers
I hope I get it correct
Before the sun rises in the west
And god sends his Messiah
And then he wakes up the tired and is done
Hometown hero
Chicago’s tomorrow
West side hanger
Yes he’s danger
Didn’t you know?
He’s here!
