The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
[Hook]
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young history as
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what

I love the Lord
But sometimes it's like that I love me more
I love the peace and I love the war
I love the seas and I love the shore
beach;
baby, that's law
But she doesn't see; therefore, I spoil
I trick, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene
The obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king
together
She would make me cool and we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
reign
and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high,
and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven, set the fires in Hell
[Hook]

The Trinity:
Her and I, caine
No weather man could ever stand when her and I came
Hella hard,
umbrella, whatever
Put plywood over Pella panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
Cause you gon' need a sub til he does reply
And not one of Jared's;
you think it's all arid
e'eryt'ing's irie,
another supply
That means another July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger, Felix
Cause he is the cleanest amongst the
Younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fighting in class who might not pass
Rap record pressured to laugh at a life not fast
"Can you feel it?" Is what I got asked
"Do I love her?" Said, "I don't know"
Streets got my heart, Game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying, dishonored baby mama
Who's the mama to the daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes and a necklace
With a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door, or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?
Then ha-ha-ha-ha-ha'd right up in her face, G
There's more fish in the sea, I'm on my mission to be-be
[Hook]
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young history as
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
Come, these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool
Fast-talking of the hustle
No heaven up above you, no hell underneath ye
And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear when we're not here
And keep your faith as we chase
The Cool (Cool!)
