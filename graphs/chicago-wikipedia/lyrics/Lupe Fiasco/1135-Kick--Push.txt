Soundtrakk, what's popping baby
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
Legally, and illegally
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded
since the first kickflip he landed
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk ka-kunk ka-kunk
his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yeah, when they said "It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here"
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, and push, and coast
My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what what was happening to him now
He said "I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two"
She said "Bow, I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds
Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here"
So she took him to a spot
He didn't know about some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said "I don't normally take dates in here"
Security came and said "I'm sorry, there's no skating here"

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, and push, and coast
Before he knew, he had a crew, that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts
and SB dunks
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route, they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, and push, and coast
