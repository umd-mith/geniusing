When your spirit is strained
And you limited to change
The lyrics in your limericks'll change
A different hook, the way the sentences arranged
More demented in your deliverance, more sinister in your slang
Sounds more belligerent when it's sang
The truth is limitless in its range
If you drop a 'T' and look at it in reverse it can hurt
Look at the grimaces of the pain
And it's worse when it works and your membership is gained
But you forgetting the proof diminishes in the flames
Like 'poof',
the media pours images in your brain
Of the score of the war where militants is slain
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed
And they filthy
, the deaf ears are the winners
The listeners are the lames
Of the ballad of the man that the son of a minister has became
Wherefore does my glory go?
Wherefore does my glory go? (Glory, glory)
Wherefore does my glory go?(Wherefore does my glory go?)
Wherefore does my glory go? (Glory, glory)
But you gotta understand, our differences is the same
What starts in clouded minds, finishes in the reign
Of the fools that are used as instruments in the game
Where oppression is the queen and ignorance is the king
Where revolution is dead, no candles in is memory
No remembrance of its fame, just a mystery
No mentioning the history of the chain
No hennessy sentiments in its name
Just an unmarked grave that menaces have defamed
With the propaganda, and images of the gangs
A lost art, no apprentices in it trained
And they brainwashed, no interest in its stain
And the minds weary, all the adrenaline in it drained
While the wrecking ball is, disassembling things
Her highness is the cause, his eminence is the blame
The pride is still there, the privileges still remain, but
[Verse 3]
And you've gotta respect the position in which you playing
Never let your heart reflect the conditions in which its staying
Even if it's dark, and the temperature is the same
As winters in the Ukraine,
your appendages is in chains
Have forgiveness from the start, keep maliciousness restrained
Be smart, never indiscriminate in your aim
'Cos there's innocent witnesses oblivious to the things
That come, the one's the hypnotists keep entertained
Stay resistant, and stay committed to what you sing, 'cos
They can flip it the minute that you refrain
Read the book and the lines, and literature in between
And gotta be educated when going against the grain
Pay attention, they illegitimate in their claims
They assisted in the killing and pillaging
In addition to the addiction
Shit is much bigger than just them planes,
