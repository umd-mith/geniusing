Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
And my return,
re-up
I hold a whole like a tea-cup
World in one hand, while the other hand throw a peace up
My other hand throwing
We without the e up
I got like five more man I'm something like Shiva
In that Fall of Rome No.IV Deluxe
See I've been around the world like the gnome
But I come from a zone where the homes are beat up
The folks, unknowns, and the stones all meet up
Police tap my phone, got my songs on speaker
Say he's back to poems, got their domes all geeked up
To get up on they thrones and become young leaders
Oprah put it on my culture now if that ain't wrong
Imus got it from the rhymers now if that ain't blown
They gave my man forty four now if that ain't long
I put it all on my shoulders now if that ain't strong
I made it out alive from the streets of the westside C-H-I
Now if that ain't home you better tell em
[Hook: Pooh Bear & Snoop Dogg]
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
And in my flyness I've become the hero and the sidekick
The rider and the nigga that'll ride with
In your ear like the maker of the vivrant
Asalamalakam to the maker of the vivrant
Them other niggas I don't vibe with
Now I was bout three when the eyes went
But I could see everything that you trying to be
You can't hide it
While you coming out your throat like a heimlich
I came up out the belly like an Hype script
Hijacked the road and when they shot the pilot
I'm trying to go public so I can get to private
Then send Busy to go and get the pirates
Then hit Africa and try to fix the Virus
Go back to the hood tell Huggy open the hydrents
R.I.P Stack B. I'm gonna keep you alive kid
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
F-N-F
S-N double O-P
[Hook: Pooh Bear & Snoop Dogg]
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
Lupy, it's Snoopy lets go out/wild
Tip toe through the door do it doggy style
And tell all my chicks in Chi-I-cago
Lupy hit the Lotto, Snoopy hit the bottle
Dolemite tight
they bite, they might follow
Take this chill pill, will make you swallow
Recital is very homicidal
The big screen will capture it, cause it's hi-definition
Listen cooking collard greens in the kitchen
Them alphabet boys on a mission
If you ever get cash you better get it quick fast
Cause now-a-days niggas get the snitching on your bitch ass
Even your boys, best believe in your toys, out your game
Specially when a nigga know your real name
Blam blam with the blammer
Smile nephew your on candit camera, film at eleven
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
F-N-F and S-N double O-P
