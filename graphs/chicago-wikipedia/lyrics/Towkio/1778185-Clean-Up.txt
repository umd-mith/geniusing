Aye bro, this shit!
Well I'll wait 'til my turn
I create, this my world, you gon' learn
It could end any day
Body bags cover face, they zip up just like Bapes
Well alright, I give 'em monkey bars, them bitches hold weight
The game like Madden in '08, I swear it's fucked up
It's so young but then them young boys die old age
While I move moons, control waves, the world gon' rotate
Like okay, I get it, get it, your friends did it, they're famous
And you rap too, so when you gon' make it?
I say, "Really it's patience, but really it's condensation
And I can't wait to drop"
Don't say a lot, that work talk
but first off
I don't ever pray a lot
My mama raised me a prophet
So therefore they're gon' have to leave me no option
I got my mind on money, got control of my mind
And my mind on my vision, my mind on my mission
But this shit, this shit
This shit, better turn your shit up
This shit, better turn your shit up
This shit, better turn your shit, clean up
This shit better, this shit better
This shit better, shit better turn your shit up
This shit, better turn your shit, clean up
Well I'll wait 'til my turn
I create, this my world, put in work
What's your worth? What's your motive,
this shit'll split an ocean
It split an atom, no I don't pray to God, I pray to Moses
But see they've been quiet
They don't make no noise, I turn their shit up
So tell your mama, your daddy, your brother, your baby sister
Then call the babysitter
Someone need to watch this, I need a witness
I'm 'bout to change it, in the places I'm 'bout to take it
Work that I put in prolly'll save me a generation
I'm makin' 'em conscious now I’ll try, makin' some progress
In need of a prophet like mothafuck a double entendre
And I say, bitch I'm a problem, I say, bitch I'm a problem
