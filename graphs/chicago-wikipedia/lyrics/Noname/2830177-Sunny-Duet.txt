Name is just a name
But don't call me crazy
Rain don't feel like rain
It's been so calming lately
Love is just a word, unless you show it
So tell me, what you call me when I’m not around
I used to have a name that look like butterflies and Hennessey
I'd trade it up for happiness but joyful don't remember me
I'm sitting on my front lawn waiting for him to call me
He said he knew my name
Shame on me, fool me once, shame on you
I got my candy cane
My name is hella pimping too
You could watch a player move
Oh we could call this ice cream on my Sunday sweater
Holy water avatar
Blue like the tears when I left you
It's raining, it's storming
I approach me with caution
I come with a warning
You sweep me off my feet
I'll probably clean my act up
I swear I'll be on my best behavior
From this day forward, a lifetime after
If you're my baby
And I know this world is so damn crazy
(And I know this world is oh so crazy)
But that don't mean a thing
It can forgive me, hate me, call me crazy
As long as you know my name
I use to dream in parables
Cigarette over blunts now
Miracle Whip at Funtown
Mississippi over ice
Janet Jackson and flashing lights
We can dance a little, if you'd like to
My vagabonds is a lonely road
Sing with me, sing with me paranoia light blue
Piano was a deep red, your fingers were a green hue
I should make a rainbow out of sacrificial love in the club
Name is just a name
But don't call me crazy
Rain don't feel like rain
It's been so calming lately
Love is just a word, unless you show it
So tell me, what you call me when I’m not around
