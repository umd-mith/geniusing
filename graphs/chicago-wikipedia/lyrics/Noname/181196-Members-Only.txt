[Verse 1]
Mixtape so sour
Industry's new tower
Knew the power of love
Say your weed is from Cali
Say your bitch is from Maui
Say you love yourself, say the money don't drive you crazy
Kinda funny how the honey laced yo' blunts lately
Shit still ain't sweet, ya'll still don't speak
But at least you got the cover of Vogue
And the white girls know yo' name
And the black girls want yo' baby
And the white girls want yo' baby
Hip hop hypocrisy, sold in a white economy
Enchanted semantics of ghetto bibliography
Keep the images of blacks all the same
Keep the dollars in their pockets so the lyrics never change
We got money, we got diamonds
And we got money, we got housin'
Where schools cut fundin',
We got drafted and we got we got money
We got we got money
We got money
