[Intro]
"I'll call the cops!"
"Yeah baby, you call the police and tell them we got two imposters up here running a scam because I'm Ms. Frankie Lymon!"
"I'm Mrs. Frankie Lymon!" "I am Mrs. Frankie Lymon"
"Jesus Christ, it's a God damn game show!"
Gang! Ballin' Like I'm Kobe the mixtape
I keep .45 on my side, man you know I can't go
Niggas plotting, I know they mad cause I got all these rolls
All these hoes, all these clothes, all these jewels
All these bitches over me, they don't want you
All my diamonds, I be shinin'
Presidential Rollie, it say timeless
All I know is hustle, I be grindin'
If you looking for me, you can find me
If you looking you can find me on the 8 block me and all my niggas grindin'
"Herbo, whats been happening since the tape dropped?" Me and all my niggas shinin'
Wrist cost me bout a brick still look on my phone to see what time is
And my fit cost a couple G's, I can see a deal before I sign it
All these bitches over me, I feel like Frankie Lymon
I'm so high, I may O.D, I feel like Frankie Lymon
I might buy my sis a couple 'fits if she get an A on her assignment
I'm a young nigga, I'm a businessman, I take care of business, man
And I and a slap a bitch in a minute, man, so yes, I'm a minuteman
Keep my pistol on me everywhere I go, don't give a fuck about no sentence, man
Off the drink you know it got me moving slow, I'm leaning like I'm trynna kick a stand
Rollin' up the thrax,
pour a hi-tech, but I really miss the act
Fuck a nigga bitch, then I give her back
Don't want her to get attatched
I don't look at tags, while I'm in the store, all I do is spend a sack
I don't trip about it, I'm a hustler, I know I'mma get it back
20's, 50's, 100's, Herbo thumbin' through a check
Want a feature? Hit my jack, I ain't hoppin' on it if it's wack
Fuck a industry catch me in the streets, might not send your money back
And my gun up on me if a nigga run up on me, he ain't running back
