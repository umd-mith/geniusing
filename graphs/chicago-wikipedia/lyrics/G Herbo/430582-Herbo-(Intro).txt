[Verse]
Fuck next up, I took off a while back
And all I ever do is fuck bitches and count stacks
Yeah I spazz, I just run through them digits and bounce back
Niggas mad, pillow talking to bitches about rap
[Verse]
No limit and it's no limit to this street shit
Got the whole city on MB dick
Since I threw Reese on the remix
But I been doing this rap shit and street shit
You can always catch me over east with it
And my niggas shoot for no reason cause the opps got poor defense
[Verse]
First off bitch it's EBK, GDK
Terror Town, slam the rakes
Grab the eight, blam his face
That's how I handle shit
Fazoland, candles lit
Seven-nine, Essex ho
Shit'll get hectic, ho
[Verse]
If you lowkey, better hope it last, cause we on that
And I don't think y'all want that
Leave a nigga stinking on Colfax
Speeding in the Lincoln, no throwback
Now I'm back up on the Essex block
.30 poppers with a extra Glock
My niggas got 47 sweating hot
So you better run when that Beretta cocked
[Verse]
M-O-B I don't love a ho
Imma be this way 'til I'm forty six
Matter of fact 'til a nigga die
Smoke kush blunts 'til a nigga cry
And I never feed off another man
Cause I understand how a nigga lie
