Every day in Chicago
Need a gun to go here, Need a gun to go there
Every day in Chicago
Bro 'nem tryna go slide on these bitches
If they ain't got that pole on 'em
Man shit, over with I ain't even gone lie
Every day in Chicago
A lot of bodies getting dropped all type of shit, man
Every day in Chicago (Squad!)
Look, I'ma tell you the truth
Growing up in the Chi, I ain't got nothing to lose
I done seen a lot of mommas cry, I done had a lot of homies die
You can't walk in my shoes
Out here in the field you don't do what I do
Ma ask me every day, "Boy, what you gone do?"
I'ma get to this cake ma, we gone be straight
But I told her either way I ain't going to no school!
You can catch me on the 8 with the 8
Lil Bro got the K, either way still got that tool
Eyes open everywhere, boy, I know I can't snooze
You a real street nigga then I'm just like you
Between my squad and my family, I hate to choose
Granny tell me all the time, “Boy, I pray for you.”
Don’t wanna change the channel and see I made the news
A lot of bodies getting dropped and they don’t make the news
If you out here in the streets then you know wassup
Everybody wanna know why it’s so fucked up
Wonder why the young niggas don’t give no fuck
Cause we know don’t nobody give a fuck about us
So we shoot guns and we gangbang
And we post up each and every day
Fuck the police we gone sell weight
Till the people show us a better way

Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago (4x)
They got gangstas on that side, It’s savages on this side
Them junkies on the block robbing ladies for a hit now
Never ever ever did I give a fuck about no bitch
I was too busy tryna' make a 100 off a flip
choppers
They start running, lil bro gone let off 100 out that clip
Why they snitching, why they snitching?
Why all these niggas snitching?
We don’t want prosecution, we execute the witness
A nigga get whacked probably over chit chat
Now his homies ride around with the tech tryna' get they lick back
It’s still the same shit, bitch, I roll with the same clique
Pocket full of Ben Franklin’s no change bitch
And I’ll never ever change it

Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago (4x)
