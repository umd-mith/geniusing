So much money keep coming, I get it like "what I'ma do with that?"
Buy choppas and clips hold a hunnid, now what I'ma do with that?
Wonder who I'ma shoot with that
Ride through the 8 block and the Rugers clap
Call up J.Dot, broad day face shot
Hollows make his face drop, knock his noodles back
Now how true is that?
Yeah my niggas they doing that
All black, lets go do a hit
Hoodie on, they like "who is that?"
We at war, we got stupid shit
Talking 50 shot macs with the cooling kit
Fazoland where I'm cooling at
Bodies drop, I don't got nothing to do with that
And man it's crazy, that I ain't even made it, but these niggas hate me
And I'm patient cuz I'm still in 1st place, but I ain't even racing
I'm just sprinting to 100's and 50's and Beamers and Bentleys
Yea its with me, if you want it come get me
I move with that semi
Don't come near me, cause I'll act a fool with that semi
In that new SRT8 with a whole pint of drank and a tool in this hemi
Heater right on my lap yea so I'm cool in this Hemi
And when I stop at the light I make sure I grip tight on that pipe
[Hook]
I know niggas out for my life
Gotta look to my left and my right
I'll be damned I get left at the light
Summertime, I remember them nights (2x)
Me and Kobe off ACT with the sprite
He just left and they took his life
Wish the lord woulda just let him fight
But don't trip man its gon be aight
Cuz I got lil niggas tryna earn stripes
I could write them a check for your life
They might walk up and check you tonight
40 sneeze we gon' bless you tonight
Mask up broski, lets do it right
Catch a crowd bring them choppas out
Ain't no shooting out the car, nah bro'nem hopping out
Yea, smash on sight fuck the cops we gon' pop it out
And we stay in the field, block busting I'm popping out
NO LIMIT's what's popping now
City love me, ain't nun else to talk about
Labels all on my bumper now
Call Mikk like "bro, what they talking bout?"
If they ain't talking them M's, ain't none else to talk about
Wait 'till my tape drop, watch the label start stalking now
