I'm sleeping here with lust, scenes of ménages with Asian massages
Sin is the sin of my apartment
She can feel the rhythm as I give her my guitar licks
Mmm
She never knew I was an artist
I play the instrument well in a dark lit room
Ever seen a flower in a darkness bloom?
I know you never have, love
And we all got is lust
I think this song started in the bathtub
Then the melody continued to a back rub
You told me your homegirl can play the sax
Well show me if she can play my notes perfectly, you're making me a fan
In between your smiles were the sounds of our whispers
As I'm looking down such a bountiful picture
I look at her, then look at you
And both of you make such a beautiful muse for this music
But this is not a Mozart movement, but baby girl keep your composure
I'm not done with composing, it's the look of lust
Know that homie notice her body rather her conversation
a vampire in Jordan laces
Panties on the premises, pantry full of condoms
Fuck your conscious, let's get intimate
She said, "Baby boy slow down
You know I move with diligence
You think that I'm a ho now and strip me from my innocence?"
Hmm...She was older, she was colder than the rest of 'em
Repeatedly shook my hand I said, "Whats wrong should I kiss it first?"
I can do that I won't complain
But first you gotta fuck my brain like a surgeon
Get your mental working
Like a 9 to 5, before we get it live and close the curtains."
For you to rendez-vous, I know your needs have a purpose
Cause I have feelings too
And you have feelings, but that's only in your teeth when they're hurting
She pulled my card like pitty-pat
Walking through the streets, I met a palm reader
She told me I was wise beyond my years
Says I've been here before, well I guess that I'm just here for more of the lust
Will she keep this on the hush? I like the ones that never blush
Uh-uh, yeah, now you seduced by the serpent
Wine on your lips, I'm close enough to know that that's as fine as it gets
I'm in too deep and I'm diving for dinner
She lets me know that she's a synchronized swimmer
Blind-folded heckling, you can't see her
But I'm guessing that she's got the look of lust
Uh-uh, yea
