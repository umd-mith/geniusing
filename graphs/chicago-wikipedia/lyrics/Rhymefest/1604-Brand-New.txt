Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't, because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up, they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin', my feet is up
I'm leavin' you haters like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up
I state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front
Make black history every day, I don't need a month
The survey says, by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and
Now some women hit the mall and some shop at the thrift store
Some of 'em mix and match to make it look like they get more
Some of y'all know you wear a sixteen, squeezin' into a six
Damn, what you make them jeans rip for?
I guess she's lookin' for a (brand new) man who
Ain't always gotta sit down cause he can't stand you
While you givin' me head like shampoo, come as you came
Skip the (brand) name, I won't (brand) you
What you do here stay here like Cancun
Besides your breasts is augmented, I like things authentic
Look at all my whips, they're all vintage
I got a loft with a view of the sea
See I take some old shit and make it (new) for me
Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree
Why spend and arm and a leg, we can kick it for free you see
Che
bustin' and then hit 'em, fuck the cynicism
I'm quick to give y'all niggas constructive criticism
Like "Wait, you basically suck,"
his mother said "My son wanna rhyme!"
I'm like Ma'am, I don't agree with that decision
Nothin' against him, but if he step I gotta diss him
I listen to that weak shit, all of it, I can't follow it
I'm wack-tose intolerant
blue collar
Now I'm in the club, and look who I get it poppin' with
Me and 'Ye
go back like crew cuts
He hook me up, as long as I don't ask him for too much
But even he know 'Fest is layin' it down
Cause this is just an old beat he had layin' around
